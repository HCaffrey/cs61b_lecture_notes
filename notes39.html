<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">

<p>Objects take up space in memory.  If your program creates lots of objects,
throws them away, and creates more, you might eventually run out of memory.
To reduce the chance that this will happen, Java has garbage collection.
</p>
<p>
While the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) runs your program, it also spends little
bits of time searching for objects that you're no longer using, so it can
reclaim their memory for use by other objects.
</p>
<p>
You don't have to know anything about garbage collection to be an effective
Java programmer.  But garbage collection is interesting because the JVM uses
a lot of hidden data structures to manage memory.  These data structures are
hidden from your Java program&ndash;after all, the JVM, just like any other
encapsulated module, should hide the details of how it is implemented.  Here's
a peak at what's going on under the hood.
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-1-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-2">Roots and Reachability</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2">

<p>Garbage collection's prime directive is to never sweep up an object your
program might possibly use or inspect again.  These objects are said to be
<span style="text-decoration:underline;">live</span>.  The opposite of "live" is <span style="text-decoration:underline;">garbage</span>&ndash;objects that your program cannot
reference again.  Java's design makes it possible for the JVM to determine
whether an object can ever be used again by your program or not.
</p>
<p>
Garbage collection begins at the roots.  A <span style="text-decoration:underline;">root</span> is any object reference your
program can access directly, without going through another object.  There are
two kinds (that we know about).  First, every local variable (including
parameters) in every stack frame on the program stack is a root if it is
a reference.  (Primitive types like ints are not roots; only references are.)
Second, every class variable (aka "static" field) that is a reference is a
root.
</p>
<p>
An object is live, and should not be garbage collected, if
</p><ul>
<li>it is referenced by a root (obviously), or
</li>
<li>it is referenced by a field in another live object.
</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that this definition is recursive.  Another way to say it is that an
object is live if it is <span style="text-decoration:underline;">reachable</span> from the roots.  If you run depth-first
search starting at all the roots, you will visit all the live objects and
none of the garbage.  And that's exactly what garbage collectors do:  run
depth-first search from the roots.
</p>
<p>
Each object has a small tag that allows the garbage collector to mark whether
the object has been visited or not.  The tag is invisible to your Java program,
but it takes a few bits of the object's memory.  (This is not the only "hidden"
memory Java associates with an object&ndash;for example, every object has a hidden
label that tells Java what class it's in.)
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-1-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-3">Memory Addresses</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-3">

<p>In any modern computer, memory is one huge array of bytes with addresses.
</p>



<pre class="src src-text">----------------------------
|   |   |   |   |   |   |   ...
----------------------------
  0   1   2   3   4   5   6
</pre>


<p>
However, modern computers prefer to read or write four bytes at a time, and
they do this much faster if the four bytes start at an address divisible by
four, so that's how things like ints and floats are stored.
</p>
<p>
Every time you declare a local variable, you are naming a memory location.
(You pick the name, Java picks the address.)  An assignment statement writes
something into a memory location.
</p>



<pre class="src src-text">              bob
   -----------------------------                         int bob;
...  |   |   | 3 |   |   |   |  ...
   -----------------------------                         bob = 3;
      208 212 216 220 224 228
</pre>


<p>
Computers can store memory addresses in memory.  To reduce the number of
syllables, memory addresses are called <span style="text-decoration:underline;">pointers</span> for short.  Some languages
like C allow you to declare variables that are pointers.  A pointer field is
a memory location that points to another memory location.
</p>



<pre class="src src-text">              bob     ptr
   -----------------------------
...  |   |   | 3 |   |216|   |  ...
   --------------------+--------
      208 212 216 220  |  228
               ^       |
               |       |
               \-------/
</pre>


<p>
Java uses pointers too, but it considers them confidential information, and
won't let you print them or look at the numbers directly.  Java references are
a little bit like pointers, but as we'll learn soon, they're actually more
complicated than pointers.
</p>
<p>
The important point is that your computer's memory is just one giant array that
has no structure except the structure you impose on it.  Java saves you a huge
amount of time and effort by structuring memory for you.  Java does this by
using hidden pointer-based data structures that you can't access from a Java
program.
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-1-4" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-4">Mark and Sweep Garbage Collection</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-4">

<p>A mark-and-sweep garbage collector runs in two separate phases.  The <span style="text-decoration:underline;">mark</span>
phase does a DFS from every root, and marks all the live objects.  The <span style="text-decoration:underline;">sweep</span>
phase does a pass over all the objects in memory.  Each object that was not
marked as being live is garbage, and its memory is reclaimed.
</p>
<p>
How does the sweep phase do a pass over all the objects in memory?  The JVM has
an elaborate internal data structure for managing the heap.  This hidden data
structure keeps track of free memory and allocated memory so that new objects
can be allocated without overwriting live ones.  Time prevents my describing
Java's heap data structure here, but it allows the garbage collector to do
a pass over every object, even the ones that are not live.  It's roughly like
an invisible linked list that links <span style="text-decoration:underline;">everything</span>.
</p>
<p>
Similarly, the stack frames on the stack are data structures that make it
possible for the garbage collector to determine which data on the stack are
references, and which are not.
</p>
<p>
When a mark-and-sweep collector runs, your program stops running for an instant
while the garbage collector does a mark pass and a sweep pass.  The garbage
collector is typically started when the JVM tries to create a new object but
doesn't have enough memory for it.
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-1-5" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-5">Compaction</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-5">

<p>Typical programs allocate and forget a good many objects.  One problem that
arises is <span style="text-decoration:underline;">fragmentation</span>, the tendency of the free memory to get broken up
into lots of small pieces.  Fragmentation can render Java unable to allocate a
large object despite having lots of free memory available.
</p>
<p>
(Fragmentation also means that the memory caches and virtual memory don't
perform as well.  If you don't know why, wait until CS 61C or CS 152.)
</p>
<p>
To solve this problem, a compacting garbage collector actually picks up the
objects and moves them to different locations in memory, thereby removing the
space between the objects.  This is easily done during the sweep phase.
</p>



<pre class="src src-text">-------------------------------------    -------------------------------------

-------------------------------------    -------------------------------------

<div id="outline-container-1-6" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-6">References</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-6">

<p>There's a problem here:  if we pick up an object and move it, what about all
the references to that object?  Aren't those references wrong now?
</p>
<p>
Interestingly, in the Oracle JVM, a reference isn't a pointer.  A reference is
a handle.  A <span style="text-decoration:underline;">handle</span> is a pointer to a pointer.
</p>
<p>
When an object moves, Java corrects the second pointer so it points to the
object's new address.  That way, even if there are a million references to the
object, they're all corrected in one fell swoop.  The "second pointers" are
kept in a special table, since they don't take as much memory as objects.
</p>



<pre class="src src-text">reference reference reference              reference reference reference
     |        |        |                        |        |        |     
     |        v        |                        |        v        |     
     \-----&gt;====&lt;------/                        \-----&gt;====&lt;------/     
        /---+- |                   ==&gt;                 | -+----\        
        |   ====                                       ====    |
        v                                                      v
       object                                                object
    "Over here"                                       "No, wait, over here"
</pre>


<p>
The special table of "second pointers" does not suffer from fragmentation
because all pointers have exactly the same size.  Objects suffer from
fragmentation because when a small object is garbage collected, the space it
leaves behind might not be large enough to accommodate a larger object.  But
a garbage-collected object's "second pointer" can simply be reused by any newly
constructed object that comes along, because all "second pointers" have the
same size.

<div id="outline-container-1-7" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-7">Copying Garbage Collection</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-7">

<p>Copying garbage collection is an alternative to mark and sweep.  It does
compaction, but it is faster than mark and sweep with compaction because there
is only one phase, rather than a mark phase and a sweep phase.
</p>
<p>
Memory is divided into two distinct spaces, called the old space and the new
space.  A copying garbage collector finds the live objects by DFS as usual, but
when it encounters an object in the old space, it <span style="text-decoration:underline;">immediately</span> moves it to the
new space.  The object is moved to the first available memory location in the
new space, so compaction is part of the deal.  After all the objects are moved
to the new space, the garbage objects that remain in the old space are simply
forgotten.  There is no need for a sweep phase.
</p>
<p>
Next time the garbage collector runs, the new space is relabeled the "old
space" and the old space is relabeled the "new space".  Long-lived objects may
be copied back and forth between the two spaces many times.
</p>
<p>
While your program is running (between garbage collections), all your objects
are in one space, while the other space sits empty.
</p>
<p>
The advantage of copying garbage collection is that it's fast.  The
disadvantage is that you effectively cut in half the amount of heap memory
available to your program.
