Today's reading:  Sierra & Bates, Chapter 2; pp. 54-58, 154-160, 661, 669.
** OBJECTS AND CONSTRUCTORS

#+Begin_SRC java
String s;           // Step 1:      declare a String variable.
s = new String();   // Steps 2, 3:  construct new empty String; assign it to s.
#+END_SRC  

At this point, s is a variable that 
references an "empty" String, i.e.  
a String containing zero characters. 
#+begin_ditaa ditaa-images/img10
          +-+     +----+
        s |.+---->|    |
          +-+     +----+
#+end_ditaa
#+Begin_SRC java
String s = new String();  // Steps 1, 2, 3 combined.
s = "Yow!";               // Construct a new String; make s a reference to it.
#+END_SRC

#+begin_ditaa ditaa-images/img3
          +-+     +--------+
        s |.+---->|  Yow!  |
          +-+     +--------+
#+end_ditaa

#+Begin_SRC java
String s2 = s;            // Copy the reference stored in s into s2.
#+END_SRC

#+begin_ditaa ditaa-images/img4
          +-+     +--------+     +-+   
        s |.+---->|  Yow!  |<----+.| s2
          +-+     +--------+     +-+
#+end_ditaa

Now s and s2 reference the same object.

#+Begin_SRC java
s2 = new String(s);       // Construct a copy of object; store reference in s2.
#+END_SRC

#+begin_ditaa ditaa-images/img5
          +-+     +--------+       +-+     +--------+
        s |.+---->|  Yow!  |    s2 |.+---->|  Yow!  |
          +-+     +--------+       +-+     +--------+
#+end_ditaa

Now they refer to two different, but identical, objects.

Think about that.  When Java executes that line, it does the following things,
in the following order.
- Java looks inside the variables to see where it's pointing.
- Java follows the pointer to the String object.
- Java reads the characters stored in that String object.
- Java creates a new String object that stores a copy of those characters.
- Java stores a reference to the new String object in s2.

We've seen three String constructors:
  1.  new String() constructs an _empty string_--it's a string, but it
       contains zero characters.
  2.  "Yow!" constructs a string containing the characters Yow!.
  3.  new String(s) takes a _parameter_ s.  Then it makes a copy of the object
       that s references.

Constructors _always_ have the same name as their class, except the special
constructor "stuffinquotes".  That's the only exception.

Observe that "new String()" can take no parameters, or one parameter.  These
are two different constructors--one that is called by "new String()", and one
that is called by "new String(s)".  (Actually, there are many more than
two--check out the online Java API to see all the possibilities.)

** METHODS
Let's look at some methods that aren't constructors.

#+Begin_SRC java
s2 = s.toUppercase();       // Create a string like s, but in all upper case.
#+END_SRC

#+begin_ditaa ditaa-images/img6
   +-+     +--------+
s2 |.+---->|  YOW!  |
   +-+     +--------+
#+end_ditaa

#+Begin_SRC java
String s3 = s2.concat("!!");             // Also written:  s3 = s2 + "!!";
#+END_SRC

#+begin_ditaa ditaa-images/img7
   +-+     +----------+
s3 |.+---->|  YOW!!!  |
   +-+     +----------+
#+end_ditaa

#+Begin_SRC java
String s4 = "*".concat(s2).concat("*");  // Also written:  s4 = "*" + s + "*";
#+END_SRC

#+begin_ditaa ditaa-images/img8
   +-+     +----------+
s4 |.+---->|  *YOW!*  |
   +-+     +----------+
#+end_ditaa

Now, here's an important fact:  when Java executed the line

#+Begin_SRC java
  s2 = s.toUppercase();
#+END_SRC

the String object "Yow!" did _not_ change.  Instead, s2 itself changed to
reference a new object.  Java wrote a new "pointer" into the variable s2, so
now s2 points to a different object than it did before.

Unlike in C, in Java Strings are _immutable_--once they've been constructed,
their contents never change.  If you want to change a String object, you've got
to create a brand new String object that reflects the changes you want.  This
is not true of all objects; most Java objects let you change their contents.

You might find it confusing that methods like "toUppercase" and "concat" return
newly created String objects, though they are not constructors.  The trick is
that those methods calls constructors internally, and return the newly
constructed Strings.

** I/O Classes and Objects in Java

Here are some objects in the System class for interacting with a user:

  System.out is a PrintStream object that outputs to the screen.
  System.in is an InputStream object that reads from the keyboard.
    [Reminder:  this is shorthand for "System.in is a variable that references
                an InputStream object."]

But System.in doesn't have methods to read a line directly.  There is a method
called readLine that does, but it is defined on BufferedReader objects.

- How do we construct a BufferedReader?  One way is with an InputStreamReader.
- How do we construct an InputStreamReader?  We need an InputStream.
- How do we construct an InputStream?  System.in is one.
(You can figure all of this out by looking at the constructors in the online
Java libraries API--specifically, in the java.io library.)

Why all this fuss?

InputStream objects (like System.in) read raw data from some source (like the
keyboard), but don't format the data.

InputStreamReader objects compose the raw data into characters (which are
typically two bytes long in Java).

BufferedReader objects compose the characters into entire lines of text.

Why are these tasks divided among three different classes?  So that any one
task can be reimplemented (say, for improved speed) without changing the other
two.

Here's a complete Java program that reads a line from the keyboard and prints
it on the screen.

#+Begin_SRC java
  import java.io.*;
  
  class SimpleIO {
      public static void main(String[] arg) throws Exception {
          BufferedReader keybd =
              new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
          System.out.println(keybd.readLine());
      }
  }
#+END_SRC

Don't worry if you don't understand the first three lines; we'll learn the
underlying ideas eventually.  The first line is present because to use the Java
libraries, other than java.lang, you need to "import" them.  java.io includes
the InputStreamReader and BufferedReader classes.

The second line just gives the program a name, "SimpleIO".

The third line is present because any Java program always begins execution at a
method named "main", which is usually defined more or less as above.  When you
write a Java program, just copy the line of code, and plan to understand it a
few weeks from now.

** Classes for Web Access

Let's say we want to read a line of text from the White House Web page.  (The
line will be HTML, which looks ugly.  You don't need to understand HTML.)

How to read a line of text?  With readLine on BufferedReader.
How to create a BufferedReader?  With an InputStreamReader.
How to create a InputStreamReader?  With an InputStream.
How to create an InputStream?  With a URL.

#+Begin_SRC java
  import java.net.*;
  import java.io.*;
  
  class WHWWW {
      public static void main(String[] arg) throws Exception {
          URL u = new URL("http://www.whitehouse.gov/");
          InputStream ins = u.openStream();
          InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(ins);
          BufferedReader whiteHouse = new BufferedReader(isr);
          System.out.println(whiteHouse.readLine());
      }
  }
#+END_SRC

** Postscript:  Object-Oriented Terminology (not examinable)

In the words of Turing Award winner Nicklaus Wirth, "Object-oriented
programming (OOP) solidly rests on the principles and concepts of traditional
procedural programming.  OOP has not added a single novel concept ... along
with the OOP paradigm came an entirely new terminology with the purpose of
mystifying the roots of OOP."  Here's a translation guide.

| Procedural Programming | Object-Oriented Programming                      |
|------------------------+--------------------------------------------------|
| record / structure     | object                                           |
| record type            | class                                            |
| extending a type       | declaring a subclass                             |
| procedure              | method                                           |
| procedure call         | sending a message to the method [ack!  phthhht!] |

I won't ever talk about "sending a message" in this class.  I think it's a
completely misleading metaphor.  In computer science, message-passing normally
implies asynchrony: that is, the process that sends a message can continue
executing while the receiving process receives the message and acts on it.
But that's NOT what it means in object-oriented programming:  when a Java
method "sends a message" to another method, the former method is frozen until
the latter methods completes execution, just like with procedure calls in most
languages.  But you should probably know that this termology exists, much as it
sucks, because you'll probably run into it sooner or later.

Monday, January 27, 2014

Today's reading:  Sierra & Bates, pp. 71-74, 76, 85, 240-249, 273-281, 308-309.

** DEFINING CLASSES
An object is a repository of data.  _Fields_ are variables that hold the data
stored in objects.  Fields in objects are also known as _instance variables_.
In Java, fields are addressed much like methods are, but fields never have
parameters, and no parentheses appear after them.  For example, suppose that
amanda is a Human object.  Then amanda.introduce() is a method call, and
amanda.age is a field.  Let's write a _class definition_ for the Human class.

#+Begin_SRC java
  class Human {
      public int age;                // The Human's age (an integer).
      public String name;            // The Human's name.
  
      public void introduce() {      // This is a _method definition_.
          System.out.println("I'm " + name + " and I'm " + age + " years old.");
      }
  }
#+END_SRC

"age" and "name" are both fields of a Human object.  Now that we've defined the
Human class, we can construct as many Human objects as we want.  Each Human
object we create can have different values of age and name.  We might create
amanda by executing the following code.

#+Begin_SRC java
  Human amanda = new Human();    // Create amanda.
  amanda.age = 6;                // Set amanda's fields.
  amanda.name = "Amanda";
  amanda.introduce();            // _Method call_ has amanda introduce herself.
#+END_SRC

#+begin_ditaa ditaa-images/img13
                    +------------+
                    |      +--+  |
             +-+    |  age | 6|  |
      amanda |.+--->|      +--+  |     +----------+
             +-+    | name | .+--|---->| "Amanda" |
                    |      +--+  |     +----------+
                    +------------+    a String object
                    a Human object
#+end_ditaa

The output is:    I'm Amanda and I'm 6 years old.

Why is it that, inside the definition of introduce(), we don't have to write
"amanda.name" and "amanda.age"?  When we invoke "amanda.introduce()", Java
remembers that we are calling introduce() _on_ the object that "amanda"
references.  The methods defined inside the Human class remember that we're
referring to amanda's name and age.  If we had written "rishi.introduce()", the
introduce method would print rishi's name and age instead.  If we want to mix
two or more objects, we can.

#+Begin_SRC java
  class Human {
      // Include all the stuff from the previous definition of Human here.
  
      public void copy(Human original) {
          age = original.age;
          name = original.name;
      }
  }
#+END_SRC

Now, "amanda.copy(rishi)" copies rishi's fields to amanda.

** Constructors
Let's write a constructor, a method that constructs a Human.  The constructor
won't actually contain code that does the creating; rather, Java provides a
brand new object for us right at the beginning of the constructor, and all you
have to write (if you want) in the constructor is code to initialize the new
object.

#+Begin_SRC java
  class Human {
      // Include all the stuff from the previous definitions here.
  
      public Human(String givenName) {
          age = 6;
          name = givenName;
      }
  }
#+END_SRC

Notice that the constructor is named "Human", and it returns an object of type
"Human".  This constructor is called whenever we write "new Human(s)", where s
is a String reference.  Now, we can shorten amanda's coming-out party to

#+Begin_SRC java
  Human amanda = new Human("Amanda");
  amanda.introduce();
#+END_SRC

These lines accomplish precisely the same result as amanda's previous four
lines.

You might ask...why were we able to create a Human object before we wrote a
constructor?  Java provides every class with a default constructor, which takes
no parameters and does no initializing.  Hence, when we wrote

#+Begin_SRC java
  Human amanda = new Human();
#+END_SRC

we created a new, blank Human.  If the default constructor were explicitly
written, it would look like this:

#+Begin_SRC java
  public Human() {
  }
#+END_SRC

Warning:  if you write your own Human constructor, even if it takes parameters,
the default constructor goes away.  If you want to have the default constructor
_and_ another constructor, you must define both explicitly.

You can override the default constructor by explicitly writing your own
constructor with no parameters.

#+Begin_SRC java
  class Human {
      // Include all the stuff from the previous definitions here.
  
      public Human() {
          age = 0;
          name = "Untitled";
      }
  }
#+END_SRC

** The "this" Keyword
A method invocation, like "amanda.introduce()", implicitly passes an object
(in this example, amanda) as a parameter called "this".  So we can rewrite our
last constructor as follows without changing its meaning.

#+Begin_SRC java
  public Human() {
      this.age = 0;
      this.name = "Untitled";
  }
#+END_SRC

In this case, "this" is optional.  However, if the parameters or local
variables of a method have the same name as the fields of an object, then the
former have priority, and the "this" keyword is needed to refer to the object's
fields.

#+Begin_SRC java
  public void change(int age) {
      String name = "Tom";
  
      this.age = age;
      this.name = name;
  }
#+END_SRC

When we call "amanda.change(11)", "this" is assigned the same value as "amanda"
before the change() method begins execution.

#+begin_ditaa ditaa-images/img14
                                                   Parameters & local variables
          +-+    +------------+                    of change()
   amanda |.+--->|      +--+  |                      +--+            +--+
          +-+    |  age | 6|  |<---------------------+. | this   age |11|
                 |      +--+  |     +----------+     +--+            +--+
                 | name | .+--|---->|  Amanda  |          +--+     +-------+
                 |      +--+  |     +----------+     name | .+---->|  Tom  |
                 +------------+                           +--+     +-------+
#+end_ditaa

Now, when Java executes "this.age = age", it overwrites the 6 with an 11.
When Java executes "this.name = name", it overwrites amanda's name as below.

#+begin_ditaa ditaa-images/img15
                                                   Parameters & local variables
          +-+    +------------+                    of change()
   amanda |.+--->|      +--+  |                      +--+            +--+
          +-+    |  age |11|  |<---------------------+. | this   age |11|
                 |      +--+  |     +----------+     +--+            +--+
                 | name | .+--|--\  |  Amanda  |          +--+
                 |      +--+  |  |  +----------+     name | .+---->+-------+
                 +------------+  |                        +--+     |  Tom  |
                                 \-------------------------------->+-------+

  +----------------------------------------------------+
  | IMPORTANT:  You CANNOT change the value of "this"! |
  +----------------------------------------------------+
#+end_ditaa

A statement like "this = amanda;" will trigger a compile-time error.

** The "static" Keyword
A _static field_ is a single variable shared by a whole class of objects; its
value does not vary from object to object.  For example, if "numberOfHumans" is
the number of Human objects that have been constructed, it is not appropriate
for each object to have its own copy of this number; every time a new Human is
created, we would have to update every Human.

If we declare a field "static", there is just one field for the whole class.
Static fields are also called _class variables_.

#+Begin_SRC java
  class Human {
      public static int numberOfHumans;
  
      public int age;
      public String name;
  
      public Human() {
          numberOfHumans++;    // The constructor increments the number by one.
      }
  }
#+END_SRC

If we want to look at the variable numberOfHumans from another class, we write
it in the usual notation, but we prefix it with the class name rather than the
name of a specific object.

#+Begin_SRC java
  int kids = Human.numberOfHumans / 4;  // Good.
  int kids = amanda.numberOfHumans / 4; // This works too, but has nothing to
                                        // do with amanda specifically.  Don't
                                        // do this; it's bad (confusing) style.
#+END_SRC

System.in and System.out are other examples of static fields.

Methods can be static too.  A _static method_ doesn't implicitly pass an object
as a parameter.

#+Begin_SRC java
  class Human {
      ...
      public static void printHumans() {
          System.out.println(numberOfHumans);
      }
  }
#+END_SRC

Now, we can call "Human.printHumans()" from another class.  We can also call
"amanda.printHumans()", and it works, but it's bad style, and amanda will NOT
be passed along as "this".

The main() method is always static, because when we run a program, we are not
passing an object in.

#+begin_ditaa ditaa-images/img16
  +-----------------------------------------------------+
  | IMPORTANT:  In a static method, THERE IS NO "this"! |
  +-----------------------------------------------------+
#+end_ditaa

Any attempt to reference "this" will cause a compile-time error.

** Lifetimes of Variables

- A local variable (declared in a method) is gone forever as soon as the method
  in which it's declared finishes executing.  (If it references an object, the
  object might continue to exist, though.)
- An instance variable (non-static field) lasts as long as the object exists.
  An object lasts as long as there's a reference to it.
- A class variable (static field) lasts as long as the program runs.

Today's reading:  S&B pp. 10-14, 49-53, 75, 78-79, 86, 117, 286-287, 292, 660.

** PRIMITIVE TYPES
Not all variables are references to objects.  Some variables are primitive
types, which store values like "3", "7.2", "h", and "false".  They are:

  | byte:    | A 8-bit integer in the range -128...127.  (One bit is the sign.)    |
  | short:   | A 16-bit integer in the range -32768...32767.                       |
  | int:     | A 32-bit integer in the range -2147483648...2147483647.             |
  | long:    | A 64-bit integer, range -9223372036854775808...9223372036854775807. |
  | double:  | A 64-bit floating-point number like 18.355625430920409.             |
  | float:   | A 32-bit floating-point number; has fewer digits of precision.      |
  | boolean: | "true" or "false".                                                  |
  | char:    | A single character.                                                 |

long values are written with an L on the end:  long x = 43L;
This tells the compiler to internally write out "43" in a 64-bit format.
double and float values must have a decimal point:  double y = 18.0;
float values are written with an f at the end:  float f = 43.9f;

|                     | Object types     | Primitive types            |
|---------------------+------------------+----------------------------|
| Variable contains a | reference        | value                      |
| How defined?        | class definition | built into Java            |
| How created?        | "new"            | "6", "3.4", "true"         |
| How initialized?    | constructor      | default (usually zero)     |
| How used?           | methods          | operators ("+", "*", etc.) |

Operations on int, long, short, and byte types.
#+Begin_SRC text
    -x               x * y 
    x + y            x / y    <-- rounds toward zero (drops the remainder).
    x - y            x % y    <-- calculates the remainder of x / y.
#+END_SRC
Except for "%", these operations are also available for doubles and floats.
Floating-point division ("/") doesn't round to an integer, but it does
round off after a certain number of bits determined by the storage space.

The java.lang library has more operations in...
    - the Math class.
#+Begin_SRC java
      x = Math.abs(y);  // Absolute value.  Also see Math.sqrt, Math.sin, etc.
#+END_SRC
    - the Integer class.
#+Begin_SRC java
      int x = Integer.parseInt("1984");  // Convert a string to a number.
#+END_SRC
    - the Double class.
#+Begin_SRC java
      double d = Double.parseDouble("3.14");
#+END_SRC

Converting types:  integers can be assigned to variables of longer types.
#+Begin_SRC java
  int i = 43; 
  long l = 43;    // Okay, because longs are a superset of ints.
  l = i;          // Okay, because longs are a superset of ints.
  i = l;          // Compiler ERROR.
  i = (int) l;    // Okay.
#+END_SRC
The string "(int)" is called a cast, and it casts the long into an int.  In the
process, high bits will be lost if l does not fit in the range -2147483648...
2147483647 Java won't let you compile "i = l" because it's trying to protect you 
from accidentally creating a nonsense value and a hard-to-find bug. Java
requires you to explicitly cast longs to ints to show your acknowledgment that
you may be destroying information.

Similarly, "float f = 5.5f; double d = f;" is fine, but you need an explicit
cast for "double d = 5.5; float f = (float) d;".  Integers (even longs) can be
directly assigned to floating-point variables (even floats) without a cast, but
the reverse requires a cast because the number is truncated to an integer.

** Boolean Values

A boolean value is either "true" or "false".  Booleans have operations of their
own, signified "&&" (and), "||" (or), and "!" (not).

#+Begin_SRC text
                  a    |    b    ||  a && b  |  a || b  |    !a
               ==================||==============================
                false  |  false  ||  false   |  false   |   true
                false  |   true  ||  false   |   true   |
                 true  |  false  ||  false   |   true   |  false
                 true  |   true  ||   true   |   true   |
#+END_SRC

Boolean values can be specified directly ("true", "false") or be created by
the comparison operators "==", "<", ">", "<=", ">=", "!=" (not equal to).

#+Begin_SRC java
    boolean x = 3 == 5;       // x is now false.
    x = 4.5 >= 4.5;           // x is now true.
    x = 4 != 5 - 1;           // x is now false.
    x = false == (3 == 0);    // x is now true.
#+END_SRC

** CONDITIONALS
An "if" statement uses a boolean expression to decide whether to execute a set
of statements.  The form is

#+Begin_SRC java
  if (boolValue) {
      statements;
  }
#+END_SRC

The statements are executed if and only if "boolValue" is "true".  The
parentheses around the boolean expression are required (for no good reason).

#+Begin_SRC java
  boolean pass = score >= 75;
  if (pass) {
      output("You pass CS 61B");
  } else {
      // The following line executes if and only if score < 75.
      output("You are such an unbelievable loser");
  }
#+END_SRC

if-then-else clauses can be (1) nested and (2) daisy-chained.  Nesting allows
you to build decision trees.  Daisy-chaining allows you to present more than
two alternatives.  For instance, suppose you want to find the maximum of three
numbers.

#+Begin_SRC java
  if (x > y) {
      if (x > z) {
          maximum = x;
      } else {
          maximum = z;
      }
  } else if (y > z) {
      maximum = y;
  } else {
      maximum = z;
  }
#+END_SRC

Some long chains of if-then-else clauses can be simplified by using a "switch"
statement.  "switch" is appropriate only if every condition tests whether a
variable x is equal to some constant.

#+Begin_SRC java
  switch (month) {        |      if (month == 2) {                         
  case 2:                 |        days = 28;                              
    days = 28;            |      } else if ((month == 4) || (month == 6) ||
    break;                |                 (month == 9) || (month == 11)) {
  case 4:                 |        days = 30;                              
  case 6:                 |      } else {                                  
  case 9:                 |        days = 31;                              
  case 11:                |      }                                         
    days = 30;            |
    break;
  default:
    days = 31;
    break;
  }                   //  These two code fragments do exactly the same thing.
#+END_SRC

IMPORTANT:  "break" jumps to the end of the "switch" statement.  If you forget
a break statement, the flow of execution will continue right through past the
next "case" clause, which is why cases 4, 6, and 9 work right.  If month == 12
in the following example, both Strings are printed.

#+Begin_SRC java
  switch (month) {
  case 12:
      output("It's December.");
      // Just keep moving right on through.
  case 1:
  case 2:
  case 11:
      output("It's cold.");
  }
#+END_SRC

However, this is considered bad style, because it's hard to read and
understand.  If there's any chance that other people will need to read or
modify your code (which is the norm when you program for a business), don't
code it like this.  Use break statements in the switch, and use subroutines to
reuse code and clarify the control flow.

Observe that the last example doesn't have a "default:" case.  If "month" is
not 1 nor 2 nor 11 nor 12, Java jumps right to the end of the "switch"
statement (just past the closing brace) and continues execution from there.

** THE "return" KEYWORD
Like conditionals, "return" affects the flow of control of a program.  It
causes a method to end immediately, so that control returns to the calling
method.

Here's a recursive method that prints the numbers from 1 to x.

#+Begin_SRC java
  public static void oneToX(int x) {
      if (x < 1) {
          return;
      }
      oneToX(x - 1);
      System.out.println(x);
  }
#+END_SRC

The return keyword serves a dual purpose:  it is also the means by which a
function returns a value.  A _function_ is a method that is declared to return
a non-void type.  For instance, here's a function that returns an int.

#+Begin_SRC java
  public int daysInMonth(int month) {
      switch (month) {
      case 2:
          return 28;
      case 4:
      case 6:
      case 9:
      case 11:
          return 30;
      default:
          return 31;
      }
  }
#+END_SRC

The "return" value can be an expression.  Some examples:

#+Begin_SRC java
  return x + y - z;
  
  return car.velocity(time);

** LOOPS
*** "while" Loops
A "while" statement is like an "if" statement, but the body of the statement is
executed repeatedly, as long as the condition remains true.  The following
example tests whether n is a prime number by attempting to divide it by every
integer in the range 2...n - 1.

#+Begin_SRC java
  public static boolean isPrime(int n) {
    int divisor = 2;
    while (divisor < n) {         _ <- "divisor < n" is the _loop_condition_.
      if (n % divisor == 0) {      |
        return false;              | These lines inside the braces
      }                            | are called the _loop_body_.  
      divisor++;                  _|
    }
    return true;
  }
#+END_SRC

Here's how the loop executes.
- When Java reaches this "while" loop, it tests whether the loop condition
  "divisor < n" is true.
+ If divisor < n, Java executes the loop body {in braces}.
- When Java finishes the loop body (i.e. after executing "divisor++"), it
  tests _again_ whether "divisor < n" is true.
- If it's still true, Java jumps back up to the beginning of the loop body and
  executes it again.
- If Java tests the loop condition and finds that "divisor < n" is false, Java
  continues execution from the next line of code _after_ the loop body.

An _iteration_ is a pass through the loop body.  In this example, if n is 2 or
less, the loop body won't iterate even once.

*** "for" Loops
"for" loops are a convenient shorthand that can be used to write some "while"
loops in a more compact way.  The following "for" loop is equivalent to the
following "while" loop.

#+Begin_SRC java
    for (initialize; condition; next) {      |    initialize;   
      statements;                            |    while (condition) {
    }                                        |      statements;
                                             |      next;
                                             |    }
#+END_SRC

By convention, the "initialize" and "next" are both expressions that affect a
variable that changes every loop iteration and is central to the test.  Most
commonly, "for" statements are used to iterate while advancing an index
variable over a fixed range of values.  isPrime can be rewritten thus:

#+Begin_SRC java
    public static boolean isPrime(int n) {
      for (int divisor = 2; divisor < n; divisor++) {    _
        if (n % divisor == 0) {                           |
          return false;                                   | Loop body.
        }                                                _|
      }
      return true;
    }
#+END_SRC

A common mistake among beginning Java and C programmers is to get the condition
wrong and do one loop iteration too few.  For example, suppose you want to
print all the prime numbers in the range 2...n.

#+Begin_SRC java
    public static void printPrimes(int n) {
      int i;
      for (i = 2; i < n; i++) {        // ERROR!!!  Condition should be i <= n.
        if (isPrime(i)) {
          System.out.print(" " + i);
        }
      }
    }
#+END_SRC

Suppose we correct this method so the loop condition is "i <= n".  Think
carefully:  what is the value of i when the printPrimes method ends?

We'll come back to iteration, but first let's investigate something more
interesting to iterate on.

** ARRAYS
An array is an object consisting of a numbered list of variables, each of which
is a primitive type or a reference to another object.  The variables in an
array are always indexed from zero in increments of one.  For example, here is
an array of characters.
#+begin_ditaa ditaa-images/img20
                                      0   1   2   3
                           +-+      +---+---+---+---+
                           |.+----->| b | l | u | e |
                           +-+      +---+---+---+---+
                            c
#+end_ditaa

Like any object, an array is only useful if we can reference it, usually
through some reference variable like "c" above.  We declare c thusly:

#+Begin_SRC java
    char[] c;           // Reference to an array (of any length) of characters.
#+END_SRC

We can construct an array of four characters as follows.

#+Begin_SRC java
    c = new char[4];
#+END_SRC

Now that we have an array object, we may fill in its values by indexing c.

#+Begin_SRC java
    c[0] = 'b';         // Store the character 'b' at index 0.
    c[1] = 'l';
    c[2] = 'u';
    c[3] = 'e';
#+END_SRC

The characters in a four-element array are indexed from 0 to 3.  If we try to
address any index outside this range, we will trigger a run-time error.

#+Begin_SRC java
    c[4] = 's';         // Program stops with ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
#+END_SRC

A _run-time error_ is an error that doesn't show up when you compile the code,
but does show up later when you run the program and the Java Virtual Machine
tries to access the out-of-range index.

When c references an array, you can find out its length by looking at the field
"c.length".  You can never assign a value to the "length" field, though.  Java
will give you a compile-time error if you try.

** Primes Revisited

The printPrimes method is embarrassingly slow when n is large.  Arrays can help
us write a faster method to identify the primes from 2 to n.

The method uses an ancient algorithm called the Sieve of Eratosthenes.  All
integers are assumed prime until proven composite.  The algorithm iterates
through all possible divisors, and marks as non-prime every integer divisible
by a given divisor.  Here's the beginning of the method.

#+Begin_SRC java
  public static void printPrimes(int n) {
      boolean[] prime = new boolean[n + 1];                  // Numbered 0...n.
      int i;
      for (i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
          prime[i] = true;                       // Prime until proven composite.
      }
#+END_SRC

Why did we construct an array of length n + 1?  Because if we'd constructed an
array of length n, its elements would be numbered from 0 to n - 1.  But we'd
like to have an element numbered n.

To continue the method, we iterate over all possible divisors from 2 to the
square root of n.  For each prime value of divisor, we mark as non-prime all
integers divisible by divisor, except divisor itself.

#+Begin_SRC java
  for (int divisor = 2; divisor * divisor <= n; divisor++) {
      if (prime[divisor]) {
          for (i = 2 * divisor; i <= n; i = i + divisor) {
              prime[i] = false;                     // i is divisible by divisor.
          }
      }
  }
#+END_SRC

Math question:  why do we only need to consider divisors up to the square root
of n?

Finally, we print every integer from 2 to n that hasn't been marked non-prime.

#+Begin_SRC java
  for (i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
      if (prime[i]) {
          System.out.print(" " + i);
      }
  }
#+END_SRC

Observe that elements 0 and 1 of the array are never used.  A tiny bit of
memory is wasted, but the readability of the code is better for it.

** Multi-Dimensional Arrays
A _two-dimensional array_ is an array of references to arrays.  A three-
dimensional array is an array of arrays of arrays.  As an example, consider
Pascal's Triangle.

#+Begin_SRC texta
                                       1                  <-- row 0
                                    1     1
                                 1     2     1
                              1     3     3     1
                           1     4     6     4     1
                        1     5    10     10    5     1   <-- row 5
#+END_SRC

Each entry is the sum of the two nearest entries in the row immediately above.
If the rows are numbered from zero, row i represents the coefficients of the
polynomial (x + 1)^i.  For example, (x + 1)^4 = x^4 + 4x^3 + 6x^2 + 4x + 1.

The following method returns an array of arrays of ints that stores the first n
rows of Pascal's Triangle.

#+Begin_SRC java
  public static int[][] pascalTriangle(int n) {
      int[][] pt = new int[n][];
#+END_SRC

Here, we've just declared pt to reference an array of arrays, and constructed
an array for it to reference.  However, the arrays that this array will
reference do not yet exist.  They are constructed and filled in by the
following loop.

#+Begin_SRC java
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      pt[i] = new int[i + 1];                            // Construct row i.
      pt[i][0] = 1;                              // Leftmost value of row i.
      for (int j = 1; j < i; j++) {
          pt[i][j] = pt[i - 1][j - 1] + pt[i - 1][j];  // Sum 2 entries above.
      }
      pt[i][i] = 1;                             // Rightmost value of row i.
  }
  return pt;
#+END_SRC

Our array objects look like this:
