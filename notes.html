<h3 id="sec-1-1">Labs</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">

<p>Labs (in 271, 273, 275, 330 Soda) start Thursday.  Discussion sections start
Monday.  You must attend your scheduled lab (as assigned by Telebears) to
</p><ol>
<li>get an account (needed for Lab 1 and Homework 1), and
</li>
<li>login to turn on your ability to turn in homework (takes up to 24 hours).
</li>
</ol>

<p>You may only attend the lab in which you are officially enrolled.  If you are
not enrolled in a lab (on the waiting list or in concurrent enrollment), you
must attend a lab that has space.  (Show up and ask the TA if there's room for
you.)
</p>
<p>
You will not be enrolled in the course until you are enrolled in a lab.  If
you're on the waiting list and the lab you want is full, you can change to one
that isn't, or you can stay on the waitlist and hope somebody drops.
</p>
<p>
If you're not yet enrolled in a lab, just keep going to them until you find one
that has room for you (that week).  Once you get enrolled in a lab, though,
please always attend the one you're enrolled in.

<p>Ideally, you have taken CS 61A or E 7, or at least you're taking one of them
this semester.  If not, you might get away with it, but if you have not
mastered recursion, expect to have a very hard time in this class.  If you've
taken a data structures course before, you might be able to skip CS 61B.  See
the Course Overview and Brian Harvey (781 Soda) for details.

There will be three projects, worth 20, 30, and 20 points respectively.  You
will do the first project individually, and the last two as part of a group of
two or three students.  You may not work alone on the last two projects.
All homeworks and projects will be turned in electronically.

<p>&hellip;will be reported to the Office of Student Conduct.
</p><ol>
<li>"No Code Rule":  Never have a copy of someone else's program in your
     possession and never give your program to someone else.
</li>
<li>Discussing an assignment without sharing any code is generally okay.
     Helping someone to interpret a compiler error message is an example of
     permissible collaboration.  However, if you get a significant idea from
     someone, acknowledge them in your assignment.
</li>
<li>These rules apply to homeworks and projects.  No discussion whatsoever in
     exams, of course.
</li>
<li>In group projects, you share code freely within your team, but not between
     teams.

<h3 id="sec-1-7">THE LANGUAGE OF OBJECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-7">

<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Object</span>:  An object is a repository of data.  For example, if MyList is a
  ShoppingList object, MyList might record your shopping list.
</p>
<p>
<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Class</span>:  A class is a type of object.  Many objects of the same class might
  exist; for instance, MyList and YourList may both be ShoppingList objects.
</p>
<p>
<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Method</span>:  A procedure or function that operates on an object or a class.
  A method is associated with a particular class.  For instance, addItem might
  be a method that adds an item to any ShoppingList object.  Sometimes a method
  is associated with a family of classes.  For instance, addItem might operate
  on any List, of which a ShoppingList is just one type.
</p>
<p>
<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Inheritance</span>:  A class may inherit properties from a more general class.  For
  example, the ShoppingList class inherits from the List class the property of
  storing a sequence of items.
</p>
<p>
<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Polymorphism</span>:  The ability to have one method call work on several different
  classes of objects, even if those classes need different implementations of
  the method call.  For example, one line of code might be able to call the
  "addItem" method on <span style="text-decoration:underline;">every</span> kind of List, even though adding an item to a
  ShoppingList is completely different from adding an item to a ShoppingCart.
</p>
<p>
<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Object-Oriented</span>:  Each object knows its own class and which methods manipulate
  objects in that class.  Each ShoppingList and each ShoppingCart knows which
  implementation of addItem applies to it.
</p>
<p>
In this list, the one thing that truly distinguishes object-oriented languages
from procedural languages (C, Fortran, Basic, Pascal) is polymorphism.

<p>Java allows you to store data in variables, but first you must <span style="text-decoration:underline;">declare</span> them
and specify their <span style="text-decoration:underline;">type</span>.
</p>



<pre class="src src-java">Python:  x = 1       Scheme:  (<span style="color: #228b22;">let</span> ((x 1)) )       Java:  <span style="color: #228b22;">int</span> <span style="color: #a0522d;">x</span>;
                                                          x = 1;
</pre>

<p>
This Java declaration does two things.
</p><ol>
<li>It allocates a chunk of memory big enough to store an integer, which
       Java calls type "int".                                            
</li>
<li>It names the variable (chunk of memory) "x".                      
</li>
</ol>


<p>

</p>
<p>
Variables are used not just to store numbers, but also to <span style="text-decoration:underline;">reference</span> objects.
There are two ways to get classes of objects to play with:
</p><ol>
<li>Use one defined by somebody else.  Java has tons of pre-defined classes
     you can use.  Many come in the "Java standard library" provided with every
     Java compiler.
</li>
<li>Define your own.
</li>
</ol>


<p>
For example, Java has a built-in class called String.
</p>


<pre class="src src-java"><span style="color: #228b22;">String</span> <span style="color: #a0522d;">myString</span>;
</pre>

<p>
This does <span style="text-decoration:underline;">not</span> create a String object.  Instead, it declares a variable (chunk
of memory) that can store a <span style="text-decoration:underline;">reference</span> to a String object.  I draw it as a
box.
</p>

<p>
<img src="ditaa-images/img1_9c7153befd71fd46889b84a2b45849c7648f4d86.png"  alt="ditaa-images/img1_9c7153befd71fd46889b84a2b45849c7648f4d86.png" />
</p>

<p>
Initially, myString doesn't reference anything.  You can make it reference a
String object by writing an assignment statement.  But how do we get ahold of
an actual String object?  You can create one.
</p>
<p>
  myString = new String();
</p>
<p>
This line performs two distinct steps.  First, the phrase "new String()" is
called a <span style="text-decoration:underline;">constructor</span>.  It constructs a brand new String object.  Second, the
assignment "=" causes myString to <span style="text-decoration:underline;">reference</span> the object.  You can think of
this as myString pointing to the object.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
Unlike Scheme and Python, Java programs must be compiled before you can run
them.  <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Compilation</span> converts your written code to a machine-readable bytecode.
The advantage is a faster program than one written in Scheme.  The disadvantage
is that you have to wait for it to compile.

<h3 id="sec-1-9">Postscript:  Anatomy of a Small Java Program (for discussion section)</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-9">

<p>Assume the following code is in a file called HelloWorld.java:
</p>



<pre class="src src-java"><span style="color: #a020f0;">class</span> <span style="color: #228b22;">HelloWorld</span> {
  <span style="color: #a020f0;">public</span> <span style="color: #a020f0;">static</span> <span style="color: #228b22;">void</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">main</span> (<span style="color: #228b22;">String</span>[] <span style="color: #a0522d;">args</span>) {
    System.out.println(<span style="color: #8b2252;">"Hello, world"</span>);
  }
}
</pre>


<p>
The classes are "HelloWorld", "String", and "System".
The objects are "args", "System.out", and the string "Hello, world".
  (Actually, the first two of these are <span style="text-decoration:underline;">references</span> to objects.)
The methods are "main" and "println".  The println method prints its parameter,
and the main method prints the string "Hello, world".
</p>
<p>
You don't have the knowledge to completely understand this code yet, but don't
worry about it.  We'll take the first two lines on faith as the standard way to
start a Java program.  They'll become clear in the coming weeks.
</p>
<p>
Let's look at the innermost line first; it does all the action.  "out"
references an object whose class is PrintStream.  A PrintStream is a path by
which characters can be output by a program.  The characters that are sent
through "out" find their way to your computer screen.
</p>
<p>
System is a class which happens to contain the variable out (among many other
variables).  We have to write "System.out" to address the output stream,
because other classes might have variables called "out" too, with their own
meanings.
</p>
<p>
"println" is a method (procedure) of the class PrintStream.  Hence, we can
invoke "println" from any PrintStream object, including System.out.  "println"
takes one parameter, which can be a string.
</p>
<p>
"main" is a method in the "HelloWorld" class.  The HelloWorld class knows how
to do the "main" operation, just like the PrintStream class knows how to do the
"println" operation.
</p>
<p>
<img src="ditaa-images/img4_1cf5f828f16ff1b51682f6d33c7c7c39e0f41f03.png"  alt="ditaa-images/img4_1cf5f828f16ff1b51682f6d33c7c7c39e0f41f03.png" />
</p>

<p>
The classes System and PrintStream are all automatically provided for you by
any Java compiler.  Somebody has programmed them for you, so that you don't
have to figure out for yourself how to send characters to the terminal.

<pre class="src src-java"><span style="color: #228b22;">String</span> <span style="color: #a0522d;">s</span>;           <span style="color: #b22222;">// </span><span style="color: #b22222;">Step 1:      declare a String variable.</span>

</pre>


<p>
At this point, s is a variable that 
references an "empty" String, i.e.  
a String containing zero characters. 
</p>
<p>
<img src="ditaa-images/img10_bb39b419e4e832fac0134d053d5b2dd655a0add9.png"  alt="ditaa-images/img10_bb39b419e4e832fac0134d053d5b2dd655a0add9.png" />
</p>



<pre class="src src-java"><span style="color: #228b22;">String</span> <span style="color: #a0522d;">s</span> = <span style="color: #a020f0;">new</span> <span style="color: #228b22;">String</span>();  <span style="color: #b22222;">// </span><span style="color: #b22222;">Steps 1, 2, 3 combined.</span>
s = <span style="color: #8b2252;">"Yow!"</span>;               <span style="color: #b22222;">// </span><span style="color: #b22222;">Construct a new String; make s a reference to it.</span>
</pre>



<p>

</p>




<pre class="src src-java"><span style="color: #228b22;">String</span> <span style="color: #a0522d;">s2</span> = s;            <span style="color: #b22222;">// </span><span style="color: #b22222;">Copy the reference stored in s into s2.</span>

</p>

<p>
Now s and s2 reference the same object.
</p>



<pre class="src src-java">s2 = <span style="color: #a020f0;">new</span> <span style="color: #228b22;">String</span>(s);       <span style="color: #b22222;">// </span><span style="color: #b22222;">Construct a copy of object; store reference in s2.</span>
</pre>



<p>
<img src="ditaa-images/img5_d22e4d66d1296af933b900d0ede3f222a2c87b6f.png"  alt="ditaa-images/img5_d22e4d66d1296af933b900d0ede3f222a2c87b6f.png" />
</p>

<p>
Now they refer to two different, but identical, objects.
</p>
<p>
Think about that.  When Java executes that line, it does the following things,
in the following order.
</p><ul>
<li>Java looks inside the variables to see where it's pointing.
</li>
<li>Java follows the pointer to the String object.
</li>
<li>Java reads the characters stored in that String object.
</li>
<li>Java creates a new String object that stores a copy of those characters.
</li>
<li>Java stores a reference to the new String object in s2.
</li>
</ul>


<p>
We've seen three String constructors:
</p><ol>
<li>new String() constructs an <span style="text-decoration:underline;">empty string</span>&ndash;it's a string, but it
       contains zero characters.
</li>
<li>"Yow!" constructs a string containing the characters Yow!.
</li>
<li>new String(s) takes a <span style="text-decoration:underline;">parameter</span> s.  Then it makes a copy of the object
       that s references.
</li>
</ol>


<p>
Constructors <span style="text-decoration:underline;">always</span> have the same name as their class, except the special
constructor "stuffinquotes".  That's the only exception.
</p>
<p>
Observe that "new String()" can take no parameters, or one parameter.  These
are two different constructors&ndash;one that is called by "new String()", and one
that is called by "new String(s)".  (Actually, there are many more than
two&ndash;check out the online Java API to see all the possibilities.)

<div id="outline-container-2-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-2">METHODS</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-2">

<p>Let's look at some methods that aren't constructors.
</p>



<pre class="src src-java">s2 = s.toUppercase();       <span style="color: #b22222;">// </span><span style="color: #b22222;">Create a string like s, but in all upper case.</span>

</p>




<pre class="src src-java"><span style="color: #228b22;">String</span> <span style="color: #a0522d;">s3</span> = s2.concat(<span style="color: #8b2252;">"!!"</span>);             <span style="color: #b22222;">// </span><span style="color: #b22222;">Also written:  s3 = s2 + "!!";</span>
</pre>



<p>
<img src="ditaa-images/img7_4923512868bfa9d7f3863f1388e52de55418c3d5.png"  alt="ditaa-images/img7_4923512868bfa9d7f3863f1388e52de55418c3d5.png" />
</p>




<pre class="src src-java"><span style="color: #228b22;">String</span> <span style="color: #a0522d;">s4</span> = <span style="color: #8b2252;">"*"</span>.concat(s2).concat(<span style="color: #8b2252;">"*"</span>);  <span style="color: #b22222;">// </span><span style="color: #b22222;">Also written:  s4 = "*" + s + "*";</span>
</pre>



<p>
<img src="ditaa-images/img8_099c9bb6c3af0de1ca50ecce4bbe3e9a22ff4d57.png"  alt="ditaa-images/img8_099c9bb6c3af0de1ca50ecce4bbe3e9a22ff4d57.png" />
</p>

<p>
Now, here's an important fact:  when Java executed the line
</p>



<pre class="src src-java">s2 = s.toUppercase();
</pre>


<p>
the String object "Yow!" did <span style="text-decoration:underline;">not</span> change.  Instead, s2 itself changed to
reference a new object.  Java wrote a new "pointer" into the variable s2, so
now s2 points to a different object than it did before.
</p>
<p>
Unlike in C, in Java Strings are <span style="text-decoration:underline;">immutable</span>&ndash;once they've been constructed,
their contents never change.  If you want to change a String object, you've got
to create a brand new String object that reflects the changes you want.  This
is not true of all objects; most Java objects let you change their contents.
</p>
<p>
You might find it confusing that methods like "toUppercase" and "concat" return
newly created String objects, though they are not constructors.  The trick is
that those methods calls constructors internally, and return the newly
constructed Strings.

<div id="outline-container-2-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-3">I/O Classes and Objects in Java</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-3">


<p>
Here are some objects in the System class for interacting with a user:
</p>
<p>
  System.out is a PrintStream object that outputs to the screen.
  System.in is an InputStream object that reads from the keyboard.
    [Reminder:  this is shorthand for "System.in is a variable that references
                an InputStream object."]
</p>
<p>
But System.in doesn't have methods to read a line directly.  There is a method
called readLine that does, but it is defined on BufferedReader objects.
</p>
<ul>
<li>How do we construct a BufferedReader?  One way is with an InputStreamReader.
</li>
<li>How do we construct an InputStreamReader?  We need an InputStream.
</li>
<li>How do we construct an InputStream?  System.in is one.
</li>
</ul>

<p>(You can figure all of this out by looking at the constructors in the online
Java libraries API&ndash;specifically, in the java.io library.)
</p>
<p>
Why all this fuss?
</p>
<p>
InputStream objects (like System.in) read raw data from some source (like the
keyboard), but don't format the data.
</p>
<p>
InputStreamReader objects compose the raw data into characters (which are
typically two bytes long in Java).
</p>
<p>
BufferedReader objects compose the characters into entire lines of text.
</p>
<p>
Why are these tasks divided among three different classes?  So that any one
task can be reimplemented (say, for improved speed) without changing the other
two.
</p>
<p>
Here's a complete Java program that reads a line from the keyboard and prints
it on the screen.
</p>



<pre class="src src-java"><span style="color: #228b22;">im</span><span style="color: #a020f0;">port</span> <span style="color: #008b8b;">java</span>.<span style="color: #008b8b;">io</span>.*;

        System.out.println(keybd.<span style="color: #228b22;">readLine</span>());
    }
}
</pre>


<p>
Don't worry if you don't understand the first three lines; we'll learn the
underlying ideas eventually.  The first line is present because to use the Java
libraries, other than java.lang, you need to "import" them.  java.io includes
the InputStreamReader and BufferedReader classes.
</p>
<p>
The second line just gives the program a name, "SimpleIO".
</p>
<p>
The third line is present because any Java program always begins execution at a
method named "main", which is usually defined more or less as above.  When you
write a Java program, just copy the line of code, and plan to understand it a
few weeks from now.

<p>
In the words of Turing Award winner Nicklaus Wirth, "Object-oriented
programming (OOP) solidly rests on the principles and concepts of traditional
procedural programming.  OOP has not added a single novel concept &hellip; along
with the OOP paradigm came an entirely new terminology with the purpose of
mystifying the roots of OOP."  Here's a translation guide.

<p>
I won't ever talk about "sending a message" in this class.  I think it's a
completely misleading metaphor.  In computer science, message-passing normally
implies asynchrony: that is, the process that sends a message can continue
executing while the receiving process receives the message and acts on it.
But that's NOT what it means in object-oriented programming:  when a Java
method "sends a message" to another method, the former method is frozen until
the latter methods completes execution, just like with procedure calls in most
languages.  But you should probably know that this termology exists, much as it
sucks, because you'll probably run into it sooner or later.

<p>An object is a repository of data.  <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Fields</span> are variables that hold the data
stored in objects.  Fields in objects are also known as <span style="text-decoration:underline;">instance variables</span>.
In Java, fields are addressed much like methods are, but fields never have
parameters, and no parentheses appear after them.  For example, suppose that
amanda is a Human object.  Then amanda.introduce() is a method call, and
amanda.age is a field.  Let's write a <span style="text-decoration:underline;">class definition</span> for the Human class.
</p>



<pre class="src src-java"><span style="color: #a020f0;">class</span> <span style="color: #228b22;">Human</span> {
    <span style="color: #a020f0;">public</span> <span style="color: #228b22;">int</span> <span style="color: #a0522d;">age</span>;                <span style="color: #b22222;">// </span><span style="color: #b22222;">The Human's age (an integer).</span>
    <span style="color: #a020f0;">public</span> <span style="color: #228b22;">String</span> <span style="color: #a0522d;">name</span>;            <span style="color: #b22222;">// </span><span style="color: #b22222;">The Human's name.</span>

    <span style="color: #a020f0;">public</span> <span style="color: #228b22;">void</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">introduce</span>() {      <span style="color: #b22222;">// </span><span style="color: #b22222;">This is a _method definition_.</span>
        System.out.println(<span style="color: #8b2252;">"I'm "</span> + name + <span style="color: #8b2252;">" and I'm "</span> + age + <span style="color: #8b2252;">" years old."</span>);
    }
}
</pre>


<p>
"age" and "name" are both fields of a Human object.  Now that we've defined the
Human class, we can construct as many Human objects as we want.  Each Human
object we create can have different values of age and name.  We might create
amanda by executing the following code.
</p>



<pre class="src src-java"><span style="color: #228b22;">Human</span> <span style="color: #a0522d;">amanda</span> = <span style="color: #a020f0;">new</span> <span style="color: #228b22;">Human</span>();    <span style="color: #b22222;">// </span><span style="color: #b22222;">Create amanda.</span>
amanda.age = 6;                <span style="color: #b22222;">// </span><span style="color: #b22222;">Set amanda's fields.</span>
amanda.name = <span style="color: #8b2252;">"Amanda"</span>;
amanda.introduce();            <span style="color: #b22222;">// </span><span style="color: #b22222;">_Method call_ has amanda introduce herself.</span>
</pre>



<p>
<img src="ditaa-images/img13_27421ef0c82df17e5737f8428ec6e33f883f3823.png"  alt="ditaa-images/img13_27421ef0c82df17e5737f8428ec6e33f883f3823.png" />
</p>

<p>
The output is:    I'm Amanda and I'm 6 years old.
</p>
<p>
Why is it that, inside the definition of introduce(), we don't have to write
"amanda.name" and "amanda.age"?  When we invoke "amanda.introduce()", Java
remembers that we are calling introduce() <span style="text-decoration:underline;">on</span> the object that "amanda"
references.  The methods defined inside the Human class remember that we're
referring to amanda's name and age.  If we had written "rishi.introduce()", the
introduce method would print rishi's name and age instead.  If we want to mix
two or more objects, we can.
</p>



<pre class="src src-java"><span style="color: #a020f0;">class</span> <span style="color: #228b22;">Human</span> {
    <span style="color: #b22222;">// </span><span style="color: #b22222;">Include all the stuff from the previous definition of Human here.</span>

    <span style="color: #a020f0;">public</span> <span style="color: #228b22;">void</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">copy</span>(<span style="color: #228b22;">Human</span> <span style="color: #a0522d;">original</span>) {
        age = original.age;
        name = original.name;
    }
}
</pre>


<p>
Now, "amanda.copy(rishi)" copies rishi's fields to amanda.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-3-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-3-2">Constructors</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-2">

<p>Let's write a constructor, a method that constructs a Human.  The constructor
won't actually contain code that does the creating; rather, Java provides a
brand new object for us right at the beginning of the constructor, and all you
have to write (if you want) in the constructor is code to initialize the new
object.
</p>



<pre class="src src-java"><span style="color: #a020f0;">class</span> <span style="color: #228b22;">Human</span> {
    <span style="color: #b22222;">// </span><span style="color: #b22222;">Include all the stuff from the previous definitions here.</span>

    <span style="color: #a020f0;">public</span> Human(<span style="color: #228b22;">String</span> <span style="color: #a0522d;">givenName</span>) {
        age = 6;
        name = givenName;
    }
}
</pre>


<p>
Notice that the constructor is named "Human", and it returns an object of type
"Human".  This constructor is called whenever we write "new Human(s)", where s
is a String reference.  Now, we can shorten amanda's coming-out party to
</p>



<pre class="src src-java"><span style="color: #228b22;">Human</span> <span style="color: #a0522d;">amanda</span> = <span style="color: #a020f0;">new</span> <span style="color: #228b22;">Human</span>(<span style="color: #8b2252;">"Amanda"</span>);
amanda.introduce();
</pre>


<p>
These lines accomplish precisely the same result as amanda's previous four
lines.
</p>
<p>
You might ask&hellip;why were we able to create a Human object before we wrote a
constructor?  Java provides every class with a default constructor, which takes
no parameters and does no initializing.  Hence, when we wrote
</p>



<pre class="src src-java"><span style="color: #228b22;">Human</span> <span style="color: #a0522d;">amanda</span> = <span style="color: #a020f0;">new</span> <span style="color: #228b22;">Human</span>();
</pre>


<p>
we created a new, blank Human.  If the default constructor were explicitly
written, it would look like this:
</p>



<pre class="src src-java"><span style="color: #a020f0;">public</span> Human() {
}
</pre>


<p>
Warning:  if you write your own Human constructor, even if it takes parameters,
the default constructor goes away.  If you want to have the default constructor
<span style="text-decoration:underline;">and</span> another constructor, you must define both explicitly.
</p>
<p>
You can override the default constructor by explicitly writing your own
constructor with no parameters.
</p>



<pre class="src src-java"><span style="color: #a020f0;">class</span> <span style="color: #228b22;">Human</span> {
    <span style="color: #b22222;">// </span><span style="color: #b22222;">Include all the stuff from the previous definitions here.</span>

    <span style="color: #a020f0;">public</span> Human() {
        age = 0;
        name = <span style="color: #8b2252;">"Untitled"</span>;
    }
}
</pre>


</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-3-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-3-3">The "this" Keyword</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-3">

<p>A method invocation, like "amanda.introduce()", implicitly passes an object
(in this example, amanda) as a parameter called "this".  So we can rewrite our
last constructor as follows without changing its meaning.
</p>



<pre class="src src-java"><span style="color: #a020f0;">public</span> Human() {
    <span style="color: #a020f0;">this</span>.age = 0;
    <span style="color: #a020f0;">this</span>.name = <span style="color: #8b2252;">"Untitled"</span>;
}
</pre>


<p>
In this case, "this" is optional.  However, if the parameters or local
variables of a method have the same name as the fields of an object, then the
former have priority, and the "this" keyword is needed to refer to the object's
fields.
</p>



<pre class="src src-java"><span style="color: #a020f0;">public</span> <span style="color: #228b22;">void</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">change</span>(<span style="color: #228b22;">int</span> <span style="color: #a0522d;">age</span>) {
    <span style="color: #228b22;">String</span> <span style="color: #a0522d;">name</span> = <span style="color: #8b2252;">"Tom"</span>;

    <span style="color: #a020f0;">this</span>.age = age;
    <span style="color: #a020f0;">this</span>.name = name;
}
</pre>


<p>
When we call "amanda.change(11)", "this" is assigned the same value as "amanda"
before the change() method begins execution.
</p>

<p>
<img src="ditaa-images/img14_31fc2b446c21c2e3ba633608733be89a99e5fa88.png"  alt="ditaa-images/img14_31fc2b446c21c2e3ba633608733be89a99e5fa88.png" />
</p>

<p>
Now, when Java executes "this.age = age", it overwrites the 6 with an 11.
When Java executes "this.name = name", it overwrites amanda's name as below.
</p>

<p>
<img src="ditaa-images/img15_2559c49357dcdd9627276b7d92640d5d5913322f.png"  alt="ditaa-images/img15_2559c49357dcdd9627276b7d92640d5d5913322f.png" />
</p>

<p>
A statement like "this = amanda;" will trigger a compile-time error.

<div id="outline-container-3-4" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-3-4">The "static" Keyword</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-4">

<p>A <span style="text-decoration:underline;">static field</span> is a single variable shared by a whole class of objects; its
value does not vary from object to object.  For example, if "numberOfHumans" is
the number of Human objects that have been constructed, it is not appropriate
for each object to have its own copy of this number; every time a new Human is
created, we would have to update every Human.
</p>
<p>
If we declare a field "static", there is just one field for the whole class.
Static fields are also called <span style="text-decoration:underline;">class variables</span>.
</p>



<pre class="src src-java"><span style="color: #a020f0;">class</span> <span style="color: #228b22;">Human</span> {
    <span style="color: #a020f0;">public</span> <span style="color: #a020f0;">static</span> <span style="color: #228b22;">int</span> <span style="color: #a0522d;">numberOfHumans</span>;

    <span style="color: #a020f0;">public</span> <span style="color: #228b22;">int</span> <span style="color: #a0522d;">age</span>;
    <span style="color: #a020f0;">public</span> <span style="color: #228b22;">String</span> <span style="color: #a0522d;">name</span>;

    <span style="color: #a020f0;">public</span> Human() {
        numberOfHumans++;    <span style="color: #b22222;">// </span><span style="color: #b22222;">The constructor increments the number by one.</span>
    }
}
</pre>


<p>
If we want to look at the variable numberOfHumans from another class, we write
it in the usual notation, but we prefix it with the class name rather than the
name of a specific object.
</p>



<pre class="src src-java"><span style="color: #228b22;">int</span> <span style="color: #a0522d;">kids</span> = Human.numberOfHumans / 4;  <span style="color: #b22222;">// </span><span style="color: #b22222;">Good.</span>
<span style="color: #228b22;">int</span> <span style="color: #a0522d;">kids</span> = amanda.numberOfHumans / 4; <span style="color: #b22222;">// </span><span style="color: #b22222;">This works too, but has nothing to</span>
                                      <span style="color: #b22222;">// </span><span style="color: #b22222;">do with amanda specifically.  Don't</span>
                                      <span style="color: #b22222;">// </span><span style="color: #b22222;">do this; it's bad (confusing) style.</span>
</pre>


<p>
System.in and System.out are other examples of static fields.
</p>
<p>
Methods can be static too.  A <span style="text-decoration:underline;">static method</span> doesn't implicitly pass an object
as a parameter.
</p>



<pre class="src src-java"><span style="color: #a020f0;">class</span> <span style="color: #228b22;">Human</span> {
    ...
    <span style="color: #a020f0;">public</span> <span style="color: #a020f0;">static</span> <span style="color: #228b22;">void</span> printHumans() {
        System.out.println(numberOfHumans);
    }
}
</pre>


<p>
Now, we can call "Human.printHumans()" from another class.  We can also call
"amanda.printHumans()", and it works, but it's bad style, and amanda will NOT
be passed along as "this".
</p>
<p>
The main() method is always static, because when we run a program, we are not
passing an object in.
</p>

Any attempt to reference "this" will cause a compile-time error.

<p>
The string "(int)" is called a cast, and it casts the long into an int.  In the
process, high bits will be lost if l does not fit in the range -2147483648&hellip;
2147483647 Java won't let you compile "i = l" because it's trying to protect you 
from accidentally creating a nonsense value and a hard-to-find bug. Java
requires you to explicitly cast longs to ints to show your acknowledgment that
you may be destroying information.
</p>
<p>
Similarly, "float f = 5.5f; double d = f;" is fine, but you need an explicit
cast for "double d = 5.5; float f = (float) d;".  Integers (even longs) can be
directly assigned to floating-point variables (even floats) without a cast, but
the reverse requires a cast because the number is truncated to an integer.

<h3 id="sec-4-3">CONDITIONALS</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-3">

<p>An "if" statement uses a boolean expression to decide whether to execute a set
of statements.  The form is
</p>



<pre class="src src-java"><span style="color: #a020f0;">if</span> (boolValue) {
    statements;
}
</pre>


<p>
The statements are executed if and only if "boolValue" is "true".  The
parentheses around the boolean expression are required (for no good reason).
</p>



<pre class="src src-java"><span style="color: #228b22;">boolean</span> <span style="color: #a0522d;">pass</span> = score &gt;= 75;
<span style="color: #a020f0;">if</span> (pass) {
    output(<span style="color: #8b2252;">"You pass CS 61B"</span>);
} <span style="color: #a020f0;">else</span> {
    <span style="color: #b22222;">// </span><span style="color: #b22222;">The following line executes if and only if score &lt; 75.</span>
    output(<span style="color: #8b2252;">"You are such an unbelievable loser"</span>);
}
</pre>


<p>
if-then-else clauses can be (1) nested and (2) daisy-chained.  Nesting allows
you to build decision trees.  Daisy-chaining allows you to present more than
two alternatives.  For instance, suppose you want to find the maximum of three
numbers.
</p>



<pre class="src src-java"><span style="color: #a020f0;">if</span> (x &gt; y) {
    <span style="color: #a020f0;">if</span> (x &gt; z) {
        maximum = x;
    } <span style="color: #a020f0;">else</span> {
        maximum = z;
    }
} <span style="color: #a020f0;">else</span> <span style="color: #a020f0;">if</span> (y &gt; z) {
    maximum = y;
} <span style="color: #a020f0;">else</span> {
    maximum = z;
}
</pre>


<p>
Some long chains of if-then-else clauses can be simplified by using a "switch"
statement.  "switch" is appropriate only if every condition tests whether a
variable x is equal to some constant.
</p>



<pre class="src src-java"><span style="color: #a020f0;">switch</span> (month) {        |      <span style="color: #a020f0;">if</span> (month == 2) {                         
<span style="color: #a020f0;">case</span> 2:                 |        days = 28;                              
  days = 28;            |      } <span style="color: #a020f0;">else</span> <span style="color: #a020f0;">if</span> ((month == 4) || (month == 6) ||
  <span style="color: #a020f0;">break</span>;                |                 (month == 9) || (month == 11)) {
<span style="color: #a020f0;">case</span> 4:                 |        days = 30;                              
<span style="color: #a020f0;">case</span> 6:                 |      } <span style="color: #a020f0;">else</span> {                                  
<span style="color: #a020f0;">case</span> 9:                 |        days = 31;                              
<span style="color: #a020f0;">case</span> 11:                |      }                                         
  days = 30;            |
  <span style="color: #a020f0;">break</span>;
<span style="color: #a020f0;">default</span>:
  days = 31;
  <span style="color: #a020f0;">break</span>;
}                   <span style="color: #b22222;">//  </span><span style="color: #b22222;">These two code fragments do exactly the same thing.</span>
</pre>


<p>
IMPORTANT:  "break" jumps to the end of the "switch" statement.  If you forget
a break statement, the flow of execution will continue right through past the
next "case" clause, which is why cases 4, 6, and 9 work right.  If month == 12
in the following example, both Strings are printed.
</p>



<pre class="src src-java"><span style="color: #a020f0;">switch</span> (month) {
<span style="color: #a020f0;">case</span> 12:
    output(<span style="color: #8b2252;">"It's December."</span>);
    <span style="color: #b22222;">// </span><span style="color: #b22222;">Just keep moving right on through.</span>
<span style="color: #a020f0;">case</span> 1:
<span style="color: #a020f0;">case</span> 2:
<span style="color: #a020f0;">case</span> 11:
    output(<span style="color: #8b2252;">"It's cold."</span>);
}
</pre>


<p>
However, this is considered bad style, because it's hard to read and
understand.  If there's any chance that other people will need to read or
modify your code (which is the norm when you program for a business), don't
code it like this.  Use break statements in the switch, and use subroutines to
reuse code and clarify the control flow.
</p>
<p>
Observe that the last example doesn't have a "default:" case.  If "month" is
not 1 nor 2 nor 11 nor 12, Java jumps right to the end of the "switch"
statement (just past the closing brace) and continues execution from there.

<h3 id="sec-4-4">THE "return" KEYWORD</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-4">

<p>Like conditionals, "return" affects the flow of control of a program.  It
causes a method to end immediately, so that control returns to the calling
method.
</p>
<p>
Here's a recursive method that prints the numbers from 1 to x.
</p>



<pre class="src src-java"><span style="color: #a020f0;">public</span> <span style="color: #a020f0;">static</span> <span style="color: #228b22;">void</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">oneToX</span>(<span style="color: #228b22;">int</span> <span style="color: #a0522d;">x</span>) {

    }
    oneToX(x - 1);
    System.out.println(x);
}

<p>
The return keyword serves a dual purpose:  it is also the means by which a
function returns a value.  A <span style="text-decoration:underline;">function</span> is a method that is declared to return
a non-void type.  For instance, here's a function that returns an int.

<h4 id="sec-5-1-1">"while" Loops</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-5-1-1">

<p>A "while" statement is like an "if" statement, but the body of the statement is
executed repeatedly, as long as the condition remains true.  The following
example tests whether n is a prime number by attempting to divide it by every
integer in the range 2&hellip;n - 1.
</p>



<pre class="src src-java"><span style="color: #a020f0;">public</span> <span style="color: #a020f0;">static</span> <span style="color: #228b22;">boolean</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">isPrime</span>(<span style="color: #228b22;">int</span> <span style="color: #a0522d;">n</span>) {
  <span style="color: #228b22;">int</span> <span style="color: #a0522d;">divisor</span> = 2;
  <span style="color: #a020f0;">while</span> (divisor &lt; n) {         _ &lt;- <span style="color: #8b2252;">"divisor &lt; n"</span> is the _loop_condition_.
    <span style="color: #a020f0;">if</span> (n % divisor == 0) {      |
      <span style="color: #a020f0;">return</span> <span style="color: #008b8b;">false</span>;              | These lines inside the braces
    }                            | are called the _loop_body_.  
    divisor++;                  _|
  }
  <span style="color: #a020f0;">return</span> <span style="color: #008b8b;">true</span>;
}
</pre>


<p>
Here's how the loop executes.
</p><ul>
<li>When Java reaches this "while" loop, it tests whether the loop condition
  "divisor &lt; n" is true.
</li>
<li>If divisor &lt; n, Java executes the loop body {in braces}.
</li>
<li>When Java finishes the loop body (i.e. after executing "divisor++"), it
  tests <span style="text-decoration:underline;">again</span> whether "divisor &lt; n" is true.
</li>
<li>If it's still true, Java jumps back up to the beginning of the loop body and
  executes it again.
</li>
<li>If Java tests the loop condition and finds that "divisor &lt; n" is false, Java
  continues execution from the next line of code <span style="text-decoration:underline;">after</span> the loop body.
</li>
</ul>


<p>
An <span style="text-decoration:underline;">iteration</span> is a pass through the loop body.  In this example, if n is 2 or
less, the loop body won't iterate even once.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-5-1-2" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-5-1-2">"for" Loops</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-5-1-2">

<p>"for" loops are a convenient shorthand that can be used to write some "while"
loops in a more compact way.  The following "for" loop is equivalent to the
following "while" loop.
</p>



<pre class="src src-java"><span style="color: #a020f0;">for</span> (initialize; condition; next) {      |    initialize;   
  statements;                            |    <span style="color: #a020f0;">while</span> (condition) {
}                                        |      statements;
                                         |      next;
                                         |    }
</pre>


<p>
By convention, the "initialize" and "next" are both expressions that affect a
variable that changes every loop iteration and is central to the test.  Most
commonly, "for" statements are used to iterate while advancing an index
variable over a fixed range of values.  isPrime can be rewritten thus:
</p>



<pre class="src src-java"><span style="color: #a020f0;">public</span> <span style="color: #a020f0;">static</span> <span style="color: #228b22;">boolean</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">isPrime</span>(<span style="color: #228b22;">int</span> <span style="color: #a0522d;">n</span>) {
  <span style="color: #a020f0;">for</span> (<span style="color: #228b22;">int</span> <span style="color: #a0522d;">divisor</span> = 2; divisor &lt; n; divisor++) {    _
    <span style="color: #a020f0;">if</span> (n % divisor == 0) {                           |
      <span style="color: #a020f0;">return</span> <span style="color: #008b8b;">false</span>;                                   | Loop body.
    }                                                _|
  }
  <span style="color: #a020f0;">return</span> <span style="color: #008b8b;">true</span>;
}
</pre>


<p>
A common mistake among beginning Java and C programmers is to get the condition
wrong and do one loop iteration too few.  For example, suppose you want to
print all the prime numbers in the range 2&hellip;n.
</p>



<pre class="src src-java"><span style="color: #a020f0;">public</span> <span style="color: #a020f0;">static</span> <span style="color: #228b22;">void</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">printPrimes</span>(<span style="color: #228b22;">int</span> <span style="color: #a0522d;">n</span>) {
  <span style="color: #228b22;">int</span> <span style="color: #a0522d;">i</span>;
  <span style="color: #a020f0;">for</span> (i = 2; i &lt; n; i++) {        <span style="color: #b22222;">// </span><span style="color: #b22222;">ERROR!!!  Condition should be i &lt;= n.</span>
    <span style="color: #a020f0;">if</span> (isPrime(i)) {
      System.out.print(<span style="color: #8b2252;">" "</span> + i);
    }
  }
}
</pre>


<p>
Suppose we correct this method so the loop condition is "i &lt;= n".  Think
carefully:  what is the value of i when the printPrimes method ends?
</p>
<p>
We'll come back to iteration, but first let's investigate something more
interesting to iterate on.

<h3 id="sec-5-2">ARRAYS</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-2">

<p>An array is an object consisting of a numbered list of variables, each of which
is a primitive type or a reference to another object.  The variables in an
array are always indexed from zero in increments of one.  For example, here is
an array of characters.
</p>
<p>
<img src="ditaa-images/img20_f18bbd524ca86827357f5a81eda9dc5b05d7e38e.png"  alt="ditaa-images/img20_f18bbd524ca86827357f5a81eda9dc5b05d7e38e.png" />
</p>

<p>
Like any object, an array is only useful if we can reference it, usually
through some reference variable like "c" above.  We declare c thusly:
</p>



<pre class="src src-java"><span style="color: #228b22;">char</span>[] <span style="color: #a0522d;">c</span>;           <span style="color: #b22222;">// </span><span style="color: #b22222;">Reference to an array (of any length) of characters.</span>
</pre>


<p>
We can construct an array of four characters as follows.
</p>



<pre class="src src-java">c = <span style="color: #a020f0;">new</span> <span style="color: #228b22;">char</span>[4];
</pre>


<p>
Now that we have an array object, we may fill in its values by indexing c.
</p>



<pre class="src src-java">c[0] = <span style="color: #8b2252;">'b'</span>;         <span style="color: #b22222;">// </span><span style="color: #b22222;">Store the character 'b' at index 0.</span>
c[1] = <span style="color: #8b2252;">'l'</span>;
c[2] = <span style="color: #8b2252;">'u'</span>;
c[3] = <span style="color: #8b2252;">'e'</span>;
</pre>


<p>
The characters in a four-element array are indexed from 0 to 3.  If we try to
address any index outside this range, we will trigger a run-time error.
</p>



<pre class="src src-java">c[4] = <span style="color: #8b2252;">'s'</span>;         <span style="color: #b22222;">// </span><span style="color: #b22222;">Program stops with ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException</span>
</pre>


<p>
A <span style="text-decoration:underline;">run-time error</span> is an error that doesn't show up when you compile the code,
but does show up later when you run the program and the Java Virtual Machine
tries to access the out-of-range index.
</p>
<p>
When c references an array, you can find out its length by looking at the field
"c.length".  You can never assign a value to the "length" field, though.  Java
will give you a compile-time error if you try.

<h3 id="sec-5-3">Primes Revisited</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-3">


<p>
The printPrimes method is embarrassingly slow when n is large.  Arrays can help
us write a faster method to identify the primes from 2 to n.
</p>
<p>
The method uses an ancient algorithm called the Sieve of Eratosthenes.  All
integers are assumed prime until proven composite.  The algorithm iterates
through all possible divisors, and marks as non-prime every integer divisible
by a given divisor.  Here's the beginning of the method.
</p>



<pre class="src src-java"><span style="color: #a020f0;">public</span> <span style="color: #a020f0;">static</span> <span style="color: #228b22;">void</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">printPrimes</span>(<span style="color: #228b22;">int</span> <span style="color: #a0522d;">n</span>) {
    <span style="color: #228b22;">boolean</span>[] <span style="color: #a0522d;">prime</span> = <span style="color: #a020f0;">new</span> <span style="color: #228b22;">boolean</span>[n + 1];                  <span style="color: #b22222;">// </span><span style="color: #b22222;">Numbered 0...n.</span>
    <span style="color: #228b22;">int</span> <span style="color: #a0522d;">i</span>;
    <span style="color: #a020f0;">for</span> (i = 2; i &lt;= n; i++) {
        prime[i] = <span style="color: #008b8b;">true</span>;                       <span style="color: #b22222;">// </span><span style="color: #b22222;">Prime until proven composite.</span>
    }
</pre>


<p>
Why did we construct an array of length n + 1?  Because if we'd constructed an
array of length n, its elements would be numbered from 0 to n - 1.  But we'd
like to have an element numbered n.
</p>
<p>
To continue the method, we iterate over all possible divisors from 2 to the
square root of n.  For each prime value of divisor, we mark as non-prime all
integers divisible by divisor, except divisor itself.
</p>



<pre class="src src-java"><span style="color: #a020f0;">for</span> (<span style="color: #228b22;">int</span> <span style="color: #a0522d;">divisor</span> = 2; divisor * divisor &lt;= n; divisor++) {
    <span style="color: #a020f0;">if</span> (prime[divisor]) {
        <span style="color: #a020f0;">for</span> (i = 2 * divisor; i &lt;= n; i = i + divisor) {
            prime[i] = <span style="color: #008b8b;">false</span>;                     <span style="color: #b22222;">// </span><span style="color: #b22222;">i is divisible by divisor.</span>
        }
    }
}
</pre>


<p>
Math question:  why do we only need to consider divisors up to the square root
of n?
</p>
<p>
Finally, we print every integer from 2 to n that hasn't been marked non-prime.
</p>



<pre class="src src-java"><span style="color: #a020f0;">for</span> (i = 2; i &lt;= n; i++) {
    <span style="color: #a020f0;">if</span> (prime[i]) {
        System.out.print(<span style="color: #8b2252;">" "</span> + i);
    }
}
</pre>


<p>
Observe that elements 0 and 1 of the array are never used.  A tiny bit of
memory is wasted, but the readability of the code is better for it.

Each entry is the sum of the two nearest entries in the row immediately above.
If the rows are numbered from zero, row i represents the coefficients of the
polynomial (x + 1)<sup>i</sup>.  For example, (x + 1)<sup>4</sup> = x<sup>4</sup> + 4x<sup>3</sup> + 6x<sup>2</sup> + 4x + 1.

The following method returns an array of arrays of ints that stores the first n
rows of Pascal's Triangle.

Here, we've just declared pt to reference an array of arrays, and constructed
an array for it to reference.  However, the arrays that this array will
reference do not yet exist.  They are constructed and filled in by the

<h3 id="sec-6-2">Automatic Array Construction</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-6-2">

<p>Last lecture, we used a loop to construct all the arrays that the top-level
array references.  This was necessary to construct a triangular array.  But if
you want a rectangular multi-dimensional array, rather than a triangular one,
Java can construct all of the arrays for you at once.
</p>



<pre class="src src-java"><span style="color: #228b22;">int</span>[][] <span style="color: #a0522d;">table</span> = <span style="color: #a020f0;">new</span> <span style="color: #228b22;">int</span>[x][y];
</pre>


<p>
This declaration constructs an array of x references to arrays.  It also
constructs x arrays of y ints.  The variable "table" references the array of
arrays; and each entry in the array of arrays references one of the arrays of
ints.  All the arrays are constructed for you at once.  Similarly, Java can
construct three- or ten-dimensional arrays for you, memory permitting.
</p>
<p>
We could have used a square array to store Pascal's Triangle, but that would
have unnecessarily wasted memory.  If you have enough memory, you might not
care.
</p>
<p>
When you declare a variable, you can also construct array entries by using
initializers.
</p>



<pre class="src src-java"><span style="color: #228b22;">Human</span>[] <span style="color: #a0522d;">b</span> = {amanda, rishi, <span style="color: #a020f0;">new</span> <span style="color: #228b22;">Human</span>(<span style="color: #8b2252;">"Paolo"</span>)};
<span style="color: #228b22;">int</span>[][] <span style="color: #a0522d;">c</span> = {{7, 3, 2}, {x}, {8, 5, 0, 0}, {y + z, 3}};
</pre>


<p>
In the second example, Java constructs a non-rectangular two-dimensional array,
composed of one array of arrays and four arrays of ints.
</p>
<p>
Sadly, you can only use this notation in a declaration.  You can't write
</p>



<pre class="src src-java">d = {3, 7};                  <span style="color: #b22222;">// </span><span style="color: #b22222;">Compile-time ERROR.</span>
f({1, 2, 3});                <span style="color: #b22222;">// </span><span style="color: #b22222;">Compile-time ERROR.</span>
</pre>


<p>
Another subtlety of array declarations is the following.
</p>



<pre class="src src-java"><span style="color: #228b22;">int</span>[] <span style="color: #a0522d;">a</span>, <span style="color: #a0522d;">b</span>, <span style="color: #a0522d;">c</span>;                           <span style="color: #b22222;">// </span><span style="color: #b22222;">a, b, and c all reference arrays.</span>
<span style="color: #228b22;">int</span> <span style="color: #a0522d;">a</span>[], <span style="color: #a0522d;">b</span>, <span style="color: #a0522d;">c</span>[][];           <span style="color: #b22222;">// </span><span style="color: #b22222;">a is 1D; c is 2D; b is not a reference/array.</span>
<span style="color: #228b22;">int</span>[] <span style="color: #a0522d;">a</span>, <span style="color: #a0522d;">b</span>[];            <span style="color: #b22222;">// </span><span style="color: #b22222;">a references a 1D array; b references a 2D array.</span>

Arrays of Objects

</p>
<hr/>
<p>
When you construct a multi-dimensional array, Java can construct all the arrays
for you.  But when you construct an array of objects, Java does not construct
the objects automatically.  The array contains space for references to the
objects.  You must construct the objects yourself.
</p>



<pre class="src src-java"><span style="color: #228b22;">String</span>[] <span style="color: #a0522d;">sentence</span> = <span style="color: #a020f0;">new</span> <span style="color: #228b22;">String</span>[3];

What is the array of Strings that the main() method takes as a parameter?
It's a list of command-line arguments sent to your Java program, prepared for
you by Java.  Consider the following program.

<p>A "do" loop has just one difference from a "while" loop.  If Java reaches

check the loop condition until the end of the first iteration.  "do" loops are
appropriate for any loop you always want executed at least once, especially if

body has been executed.

<p>
A "break" statement immediately exits the innermost loop or "switch" statement
enclosing the "break", and continues execution at the code following the loop
or "switch".
</p>
<p>
In the loop example above, we might want to skip "process(s)" when s is a
signal to exit (in this case, an empty String).  We want a "time-and-a-half"
loop&ndash;we want to enter the loop at a different point in the read-process cycle
than we want to exit the loop at.  Here are two alternative loops that do the
right thing.  They behave identically.  Each has a different disadvantage.

                                         |}
<span style="color: #b22222;">/*</span><span style="color: #b22222;">Disadvantage:  The line "s = keybd..." |</span>

</pre>


<p>
Some loops have more than one natural endpoint.  Suppose we want to iterate the
read-process loop at most ten times.  In the example at left below, the "break"
statement cannot be criticized, because the loop has two natural endpoints.  We
could get rid of the "break" by writing the loop as at right below, but the
result is longer and harder to read.

<p>
There are anti-break zealots who claim that the loop on the right is the
"correct" way to do things.  I disagree, because the left loop is clearly more
readable.
</p>
<p>
Some of the zealots feel this way because "break" statements are a little bit
like the "go to" statements found in some languages like Basic and Fortran (and
the machine language that microprocessors really execute).  "go to" statements
allow you to jump to any line of code in the program.  It sounds like a good
idea at first, but it invariably leads to insanely unmaintainable code.  For
example, what happens if you jump to the middle of a loop?  Turing Award winner
Edsger Dijkstra wrote a famous article in 1968 entitled "Go To Statement
Considered Harmful", which is part of the reason why many modern languages like
Java don't have "go to" statements.
</p>
<p>
Both "break" and "return" are limited forms of "go to" statements.  Their
limitations prohibit the worst abuses of "go to".  They allow control flow to
jump in your program in ways that are straightforward to understand.
</p>
<p>
WARNING:  It's easy to forget exactly where a "break" statement will jump to.
For example, "break" does not jump to the end of the innermost enclosing "if"
statement.  An AT&amp;T programmer introduced a bug into telephone switching
software in a procedure that contained a "switch" statement, which contained an
"if" clause, which contained a "break", which was intended for the "if" clause,
but instead jumped to the end of the "switch" statement.  As a result, on
January 15, 1990, AT&amp;T's entire U.S. long distance service collapsed for eleven
hours.  (That code was actually written in C, but Java and C use identical
syntax and semantics for loops, "switch", and "break".)
</p>
<p>
The "continue" statement is akin to the "break" statement, except
(1) it only applies to loops, and
(2) it jumps to the end of the loop body but it doesn't necessarily exit the
    loop; another iteration will commence if the loop condition is satisfied.
</p>
<p>
Finally, I told you that "for" loops are identical to certain "while" loops,
but there's actually a subtle difference when you use "continue".  What's the
difference between the following two loops?
</p>



<pre class="src src-java"><span style="color: #228b22;">int</span> <span style="color: #a0522d;">i</span> = 0;                           | <span style="color: #a020f0;">for</span> (<span style="color: #228b22;">int</span> <span style="color: #a0522d;">i</span> = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {
<span style="color: #a020f0;">while</span> (i &lt; 10) {                     |   <span style="color: #a020f0;">if</span> (condition(i)) {
  <span style="color: #a020f0;">if</span> (condition(i)) {                |     <span style="color: #a020f0;">continue</span>;
    <span style="color: #a020f0;">continue</span>;                        |   }
  }                                  |   call(i);
  call(i);                           | }
  i++;                               |
}                                    |
</pre>


<p>
Answer:  when "continue" is called in the "while" loop, "i++" is not executed.
In the "for" loop, however, i is incremented at the end of <span style="text-decoration:underline;">every</span> iteration,
even iterations where "continue" is called.

<h3 id="sec-6-4">CONSTANTS</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-6-4">


<p>
Java's "final" keyword is used to declare a value that can never be changed.
If you find yourself repeatedly using a numerical value with some "meaning" in
your code, you should probably turn it into a "final" constant.
</p>



<pre class="src src-java"><span style="color: #008b8b;">BAD</span>:     <span style="color: #a020f0;">if</span> (month == 2) {

         ...

         <span style="color: #a020f0;">if</span> (month == FEBRUARY) {
</pre>


<p>
Why?  Because if you ever need to change the numerical value assigned to
February, you'll only have to change one line of code, rather than hundreds.
</p>
<p>
You can't change the value of FEBRUARY after it is declared and initialized.
If you try to assign another value to FEBRUARY, you'll have a compiler error.
</p>
<p>
The custom of rendering constants in all-caps is long-established and was
inherited from C.  (The compiler does not require it, though.)
</p>
<p>
For any array x, "x.length" is a "final" field.
</p>
<p>
You can declare local parameters "final" to prevent them from being changed.
</p>



<pre class="src src-java"><span style="color: #228b22;">void</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">myMethod</span>(<span style="color: #a020f0;">final</span> <span style="color: #228b22;">int</span> <span style="color: #a0522d;">x</span>) {
  x = 3;                             <span style="color: #b22222;">// </span><span style="color: #b22222;">Compiler ERROR.  Don't mess with X's!</span>
}
</pre>


<p>
"final" is usually used for class variables (static fields) and parameters, but
it can be used for instance variables (non-static fields) and local variables
too.  It only makes sense for these to be "final" if the variable is declared
with an initializer that calls a method or constructor that doesn't always
return the same value.
</p>



<pre class="src src-java"><span style="color: #a020f0;">class</span> <span style="color: #228b22;">Bob</span> {
  <span style="color: #a020f0;">public</span> <span style="color: #a020f0;">final</span> <span style="color: #228b22;">long</span> <span style="color: #a0522d;">creationTime</span> = System.currentTimeMillis();
}
</pre>


<p>
When objects of the Bob class are constructed, they record the time at that
moment.  Afterward, the creationTime can never be changed.

<p>Let's consider two different data structures for storing a list of things:
an array and a linked list.
</p>
<p>
An array is a pretty obvious way to store a list, with a big advantage:  it
enables very fast access of each item.  However, it has two disadvantages.
</p>
<p>
First, if we want to insert an item at the beginning or middle of an array, we
have to slide a lot of items over one place to make room.  This takes time
proportional to the length of the array.
</p>
<p>
Second, an array has a fixed length that can't be changed.  If we want to add
items to the list, but the array is full, we have to allocate a whole new array
and move all the ints from the old array to the new one.

<p>We can avoid these problems by choosing a Scheme-like representation of lists.
A linked list is made up of <span style="text-decoration:underline;">nodes</span>.  Each node has two components:  an item,
and a reference to the next node in the list.  These components are analogous
to "car" and "cdr".  However, our node is an explicitly defined object.
</p>

Let's make some ListNodes.

<pre class="src src-java"><span style="color: #228b22;">ListNode</span> <span style="color: #a0522d;">l1</span> = <span style="color: #a020f0;">new</span> <span style="color: #228b22;">ListNode</span>(), <span style="color: #a0522d;">l2</span> = <span style="color: #a020f0;">new</span> <span style="color: #228b22;">ListNode</span>(), <span style="color: #a0522d;">l3</span> = <span style="color: #a020f0;">new</span> <span style="color: #228b22;">ListNode</span>();
l1.item = 7;
l2.item = 0;
l3.item = 6;

</p>
<p>
Now let's link them together.
</p>



<pre class="src src-java">l1.next = l2;
l2.next = l3;
</pre>


<p>
What about the last node?  We need a reference that doesn't reference anything.
In Java, this is called "null".
</p>



<pre class="src src-java">l3.next = <span style="color: #008b8b;">null</span>;
</pre>



<p>

</p>

<p>
To simplify programming, let's add some constructors to the ListNode class.
</p>



<pre class="src src-java"><span style="color: #a020f0;">public</span> ListNode(<span style="color: #228b22;">int</span> <span style="color: #a0522d;">i</span>, <span style="color: #228b22;">ListNode</span> <span style="color: #a0522d;">n</span>) {
  item = i;
  next = n;
}

<span style="color: #a020f0;">public</span> ListNode(<span style="color: #228b22;">int</span> <span style="color: #a0522d;">i</span>) {
  <span style="color: #a020f0;">this</span>(i, <span style="color: #008b8b;">null</span>);
}
</pre>


<p>
These constructors allow us to emulate Scheme's "cons" operation.
</p>



<pre class="src src-java"><span style="color: #228b22;">ListNode</span> <span style="color: #a0522d;">l1</span> = <span style="color: #a020f0;">new</span> <span style="color: #228b22;">ListNode</span>(7, <span style="color: #a020f0;">new</span> <span style="color: #228b22;">ListNode</span>(0, <span style="color: #a020f0;">new</span> <span style="color: #228b22;">ListNode</span>(6)));

<h3 id="sec-7-3">Linked lists vs. array lists</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-7-3">

<p>Linked lists have several advantages over array-based lists.  Inserting an item
into the middle of a linked list takes just a small constant amount of time, if
you already have a reference to the previous node (and don't have to walk
through the whole list searching for it).  The list can keep growing until
memory runs out.
</p>
<p>
The following method inserts a new item into the list immediately after "this".
</p>



<pre class="src src-java"><span style="color: #a020f0;">public</span> <span style="color: #228b22;">void</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">insertAfter</span>(<span style="color: #228b22;">int</span> <span style="color: #a0522d;">item</span>) {

</p>

<p>
However, linked lists have a big disadvantage compared to arrays.  Finding the
nth item of an array takes a tiny, constant amount of time.  Finding the nth
item of a linked list takes time proportional to n.  You have to start at the
head of the list and walk forward n - 1 nodes, one "next" at a time.
</p>
<p>
Many of the data structures we will study in this class will be attempts to
find a compromise between arrays and linked lists.  We'll learn data structures
that are fast for both arbitrary lookups (like arrays) <span style="text-decoration:underline;">and</span> arbitrary
insertions (like linked lists).

<div id="outline-container-7-4" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-7-4">Lists of Objects</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-7-4">


<p>
For greater generality, let's change ListNodes so that each node contains not
an int, but a reference to any Java object.  In Java, we can accomplish this by
declaring a reference of type Object.
</p>



<pre class="src src-java"><span style="color: #a020f0;">public</span> <span style="color: #a020f0;">class</span> <span style="color: #228b22;">SListNode</span> {

  <span style="color: #a020f0;">public</span> <span style="color: #228b22;">SListNode</span> <span style="color: #a0522d;">next</span>;
}
</pre>


<p>
The "S" in "SListNode" stands for singly-linked.  This will make sense when we
contrast these lists with doubly-linked lists later.  You'll see the SListNode
class in next week's lab and homework.
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-7-5" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-7-5">A List Class</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-7-5">


<p>
There are two problems with SListNodes.
</p>
<p>
(1)  Suppose x and y are pointers to the same shopping list.  Suppose we insert
     a new item at the beginning of the list thusly:
</p>


<pre class="src src-java">x = <span style="color: #a020f0;">new</span> <span style="color: #228b22;">SListNode</span>(<span style="color: #8b2252;">"soap"</span>, x);
</pre>

<p>
     y doesn't point to the new item; y still points to the second item in x's
     list.  If y goes shopping for x, he'll forget to buy soap.
</p>
<p>
(2)  How do you represent an empty list?  The obvious way is "x = null".
     However, Java won't let you call a SListNode method&ndash;or any method&ndash;on
     a null object.  If you write "x.insertAfter(item)" when x is null, you'll
     get a run-time error, even though x is declared to be a SListNode.
     (There are good reasons for this, which you'll learn later in the course.)
</p>
<p>
The solution is a separate SList class, whose job is to maintain the head
(first node) of the list.  We will put many of the methods that operate on
lists in the SList class, rather than the SListNode class.
</p>



<pre class="src src-java"><span style="color: #a020f0;">public</span> <span style="color: #a020f0;">class</span> <span style="color: #228b22;">SList</span> {

  <span style="color: #a020f0;">private</span> <span style="color: #228b22;">int</span> <span style="color: #a0522d;">size</span>;                   <span style="color: #b22222;">// </span><span style="color: #b22222;">Number of items in list.</span>

  <span style="color: #a020f0;">public</span> SList() {                    <span style="color: #b22222;">// </span><span style="color: #b22222;">Here's how to represent an empty list.</span>
    head = <span style="color: #008b8b;">null</span>;
    size = 0;
  }

  <span style="color: #a020f0;">public</span> <span style="color: #228b22;">void</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">insertFront</span>(<span style="color: #228b22;">Object</span> <span style="color: #a0522d;">item</span>) {
    head = <span style="color: #a020f0;">new</span> <span style="color: #228b22;">SListNode</span>(item, head);
    size++;
  }
}

</p>

<p>
Now, when you call x.insertFront("fish"), every reference to that SList can see
the change.

</p>

<p>
Another advantage of the SList class is that it can keep a record of the
SList's size (number of SListNodes).  Hence, the size can be determined more
quickly than if the SListNodes had to be counted.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-8-1">


<p>
Thus far, we've usually declared fields and methods using the "public" keyword.
However, we can also declare a field or method "private".  A private method
or field is invisible and inaccessible to other classes, and can be used only
within the class in which the field or method is declared.
</p>
<p>
Why would we want to make a field or method private?
</p><ol>
<li>To prevent data within an object from being corrupted by other classes.
</li>
<li>To ensure that you can improve the implementation of a class without
      causing other classes that depend on it to fail.
</li>
</ol>


<p>
In the following example, EvilTamperer tries to get around the error checking
code of the Date class by fiddling with the internals of a Date object.

    month = m;                       |      d.setMonth(0);  <span style="color: #b22222;">// </span><span style="color: #b22222;">Foiled again!!</span>
  }                                  |    }

    [Implementation with             |
     error-checking code here.]      |
  }
}
</pre>


<p>
However, javac won't compile EvilTamperer, because the Date class has declared
its vulnerable parts "private".  setMonth is an internal helper method used
within the Date class, whereas the Date constructor is a public part of the
interface of the Date class.  Error-checking code in the constructor ensures
that invalid Dates are not constructed.
</p>
<p>
Here are some important definitions.
</p>
<p>
The <span style="text-decoration:underline;">interface</span> of a class is a set of prototypes for public methods (and
sometimes public fields), plus descriptions of the methods' behaviors.
</p>
<p>
An <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Abstract Data Type</span> (ADT) is a class that has a well-defined interface, but
its implementation details are firmly hidden from other classes.  That way, you
can change the implementation of a class without jeopardizing the programs that
depend on it.  The Date class is an ADT.  We'll implement lots of ADTs this
semester.
</p>
<p>
An <span style="text-decoration:underline;">invariant</span> is a fact about a data structure that is always true (assuming
the code is bug-free), no matter what methods are called by external classes.
For example, the Date ADT enforces the invariant that a Date object always
represents a valid date.  An invariant is enforced by allowing access to
certain fields only through method calls.
</p>
<p>
An ADT is often a good thing to aspire to.  In most of your classes, you should
declare all fields private, as well as helper functions meant only for internal
use, so that you can maintain sensible invariants on your data structures.
</p>
<p>
However, not all classes are ADTs!  Some classes are nothing more than data
storage units, and do not need to enforce any invariants.  In such classes, all
fields may be declared public.

<h3 id="sec-8-2">The SList ADT</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-8-2">

<p>Last lecture, I created an SList class to solve the problems of representing
empty lists and inserting items at the beginning of a list.  Today, I want to
introduce another advantage of the SList class.
</p>
<p>
We want the SList ADT to enforce two invariants:
</p><ol>
<li>An SList's "size" variable is always correct.
</li>
<li>A list is never circularly linked; there is always a tail node whose
     "next" reference is null.
</li>
</ol>


<p>
Both these goals are accomplished by making sure that <span style="text-decoration:underline;">only</span> the methods of the
SList class can change the lists' internal data structures.  SList ensures this
by two means:
</p><ol>
<li>The fields of the SList class (head and size) are declared "private".
</li>
<li>No method of SList returns an SListNode.
</li>
</ol>


<p>
The first rule is necessary so that the evil tamperer can't change the fields
and corrupt the SList or violate invariant (1).  The second rule prevents the
evil tamperer from changing list items, truncating a list, or creating a cycle
in a list, thereby violating invariant (2).

<p>
As we saw last class, inserting an item at the front of a linked list is easy.
Deleting from the front of a list is also easy.  However, inserting or deleting
an item at the end of a list entails a search through the entire list, which
might take a long time.  (Inserting at the end is easy if you have a `tail'
pointer, as you will learn in Lab 3, but deleting is still hard.)

A doubly-linked list is a list in which each node has a reference to the

<p>
DLists make it possible to insert and delete items at both ends of the list,
taking constant running time per insertion and deletion.  The following code
removes the tail node (in constant time) if there are at least two items in the
DList.
</p>



<pre class="src src-java">tail.prev.next = <span style="color: #008b8b;">null</span>;
tail = tail.prev;
</pre>


<p>
You'll need a special case for a DList with no items.  You'll also need a
special case for a DList with one item, because tail.prev.next does not exist.
(Instead, head needs to be changed.)
</p>
<p>
Let's look at a clever trick for reducing the number of special cases, thereby
simplifying our DList code.  We designate one DListNode as a <span style="text-decoration:underline;">sentinel</span>, a
special node that does not represent an item.  Our list representation will be
circularly linked, and the sentinel will represent both the head and the tail
of the list.  Our DList class no longer needs a tail pointer, and the head
pointer points to the sentinel.
</p>



<pre class="src src-java"><span style="color: #a020f0;">class</span> <span style="color: #228b22;">DList</span> {
  <span style="color: #a020f0;">private</span> <span style="color: #228b22;">DListNode</span> <span style="color: #a0522d;">head</span>;
  <span style="color: #a020f0;">private</span> <span style="color: #228b22;">int</span> <span style="color: #a0522d;">size</span>;
}
</pre>

</p>
<p>
The invariants of the DList ADT are more complicated than the SList invariants.
The following invariants apply to the DList with a sentinel.
</p><ol>
<li>For any DList d, d.head != null.  (There's always a sentinel.)
</li>
<li>For any DListNode x, x.next != null.
</li>
<li>For any DListNode x, x.prev != null.
</li>
<li>For any DListNode x, if x.next == y, then y.prev == x.
</li>
<li>For any DListNode x, if x.prev == y, then y.next == x.
</li>
<li>A DList's "size" variable is the number of DListNodes, NOT COUNTING the
     sentinel (denoted by "head"), that can be accessed from the sentinel by
     a sequence of "next" references.
</li>
</ol>


<p>
An empty DList is represented by having the sentinel's prev and next fields
point to itself.
</p>
<p>
Here's an example of a method that removes the last item from a DList.
</p>



<pre class="src src-java"><span style="color: #a020f0;">public</span> <span style="color: #228b22;">void</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">removeBack</span>() {
  <span style="color: #a020f0;">if</span> (head.prev != head) {        <span style="color: #b22222;">// </span><span style="color: #b22222;">Do nothing if the DList is empty.</span>
    head.prev = head.prev.prev;   <span style="color: #b22222;">// </span><span style="color: #b22222;">Sentinel now points to second-last item.</span>
    head.prev.next = head;        <span style="color: #b22222;">// </span><span style="color: #b22222;">Second-last item now points to sentinel.</span>
    size--;
  }
}
</pre>


<p>
In Lab 4 and Homework 4, you'll implement more methods for this DList class.

<h3 id="sec-9-1">THE STACK AND THE HEAP</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-9-1">

<p>Java stores stuff in two separate pools of memory:  the stack and the heap.
</p>
<p>
The <span style="text-decoration:underline;">heap</span> stores all objects, including all arrays, and all class variables
(i.e. those declared "static").
</p>
<p>
The <span style="text-decoration:underline;">stack</span> stores all local variables, including all parameters.
</p>
<p>
When a method is called, the Java Virtual Machine creates a <span style="text-decoration:underline;">stack frame</span> (also
known as an <span style="text-decoration:underline;">activation record</span>) that stores the parameters and local variables
for that method.  One method can call another, which can call another, and so
on, so the JVM maintains an internal <span style="text-decoration:underline;">stack</span> of stack frames, with "main" at
the bottom, and the most recent method call on top.
</p>
<p>
Here's a snapshot of the stack while Java is executing the SList.insertEnd
method.  The stack frames are on the left.  Everything on the right half of the
page is in the heap.  Read the stack from bottom to top, because that's the
order in which the stack frames were created.
</p>

<p>
<img src="ditaa-images/TEMP_1_79b96362c6f5a001d95e9b6c17990b88bda4ba98.png"  alt="ditaa-images/TEMP_1_79b96362c6f5a001d95e9b6c17990b88bda4ba98.png" />
</p>

<p>
The method that is currently executing (at any point in time) is the one whose
stack frame is on top.  All the other stack frames represent methods waiting
for the methods above them to return before they can continue executing.
</p>
<p>
When a method finishes executing, its stack frame is erased from the top of the
stack, and its local variables are erased forever.
</p>
<p>
The java.lang library has a method "Thread.dumpStack" that prints a list of the
methods on the stack (but it doesn't print their local variables).  This method
can be convenient for debugging&ndash;for instance, when you're trying to figure out
which method called another method with illegal parameters.
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-9-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-9-2">Parameter Passing</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-9-2">

<p>As in Scheme, Java passes all parameters <span style="text-decoration:underline;">by value</span>.  This means that the
method has <span style="text-decoration:underline;">copies</span> of the actual parameters, and cannot change the originals.
The copies reside in the method's stack frame for the method.  The method can
change these copies, but the original values that were copied are not changed.
</p>
<p>
In this example, the method doNothing sets its parameter to 2, but it has no
effect on the value of the calling method's variable a:
</p>



<pre class="src src-text">method:                            | STACK (just before the method returns)
                                   |
  static void doNothing(int x) {   |      -----
    x = 2;                         |    x | 2 |
  }                                |      -----     stack frame for doNothing
                                   |-----------------------------------------
method call:                       |
                                   |      -----
  int a = 1;                       |    a | 1 |
  doNothing(a);                    |      -----     stack frame for main
</pre>


<p>
When the method call returns, a is still 1.  The doNothing method, as its name
suggests, failed to change the value of a or do anything relevant at all.
</p>
<p>
However, when a parameter is a reference to an object, the reference is copied,
but the object is not; the original object is shared.  A method can modify an
object that one of its parameters points to, and the change will be visible
everywhere.  Here's an example that shows how a method can make a change to an
object that is visible to the calling method:
</p>



<pre class="src src-text">method:                            | STACK              | HEAP
                                   |                set3|
class IntBox {                     |      -----         |
  public int i;                    |   ib | .-+----------------\
  static void set3(IntBox ib) {    |      -----         |      |
    ib.i = 3;                      |                    |      |
  }                                |--------------------|      v
                                   |      -----         |    ------

                                   |      -----     main|    ------
  IntBox b = new IntBox();
  set3(b);
</pre>


<p>
For those of you who are familiar with programming languages that have "pass
by reference," the example above is as close as you can get in Java.  But it's
not "pass by reference."  Rather, it's passing a reference by value.
</p>


<p>
Here's an example of a common programming error, where a method tries and fails
to make a change that is visible to the calling method.  (Assume we've just
executed the example above, so b is set up.)

<p>When a method calls itself recursively, the JVM's internal stack holds two or
more stack frames connected with that method.  Only the top one can be
accessed.
</p>
<p>
Here's a recursive method that searches a sorted array of ints for a particular
int.  Let i be an array of ints sorted from least to greatest&ndash;for instance,
{-3, -2, 0, 0, 1, 5, 5}.  We want to search the array for the value "findMe".
If we find "findMe", we return its array index; otherwise, we return FAILURE.
</p>
<p>
We could simply check every element of the array, but that would be slow.
A better strategy is to check the middle array element first.  If findMe is
lesser, we know it can only be in the left half of the array; if findMe is
greater, we know it can only be in the right half.  Hence, we've eliminated
half the possibilities with one comparison.  We still have half the array to
check, so we recursively check the middle element of that half, and so on,
cutting the possibilites in half each time.  Suppose we search for 1.
</p>

</p>

<p>
The recursion has two base cases.
</p><ol>
<li>If findMe equals the middle element, return its index; in the example
     above, we return index 4.
</li>
<li>If we try to search a subarray of length zero, the array does not contain
     "findMe", and we return FAILURE.
</li>

<p>
How long does binary search take?  Suppose the array has n elements.  In one
call to bsearch, we eliminate at least half the elements from consideration.
Hence, it takes log<sub>2</sub> n (the base 2 logarithm of n) bsearch calls to pare down
the possibilities to one.  Binary search takes time proportional to log<sub>2</sub> n.
If you're not comfortable with logarithms, please review Goodrich &amp; Tamassia
Sections 4.1.2 &amp; 4.1.7.

</p>

<p>
The stack frames appear at right in the figure above.  There are three
different local variables named "left" on the stack, three named "right", three
named "mid", four named "i", and four named "findMe".  While the current
invocation of bsearch() is executing, only the topmost copy of "left" is in
scope, and likewise for "right" and "mid".  The other copies are hidden and
cannot be accessed or changed until the current invocation of bsearch()
terminates.
</p>
<p>
Most operating systems give a program enough stack space for a few thousand
stack frames.  If you use a recursive procedure to walk through a million-node
list, Java will try to create a million stack frames, and the stack will
run out of space.  The result is a run-time error.  You should use iteration
instead of recursion when the recursion will be very deep.
</p>
<p>
However, our recursive binary search method does not have this problem.  Most
modern microprocessors cannot address more than 2<sup>64</sup> bytes of memory.  Even if
an array of bytes takes this much space, we will only have to cut the array in
half 64 times to run a binary search.  There's room on the stack for 64 stack
frames, with plenty to spare.  In general, recursion to a depth of roughly
log n (where n is the number of items in a data structure) is safe, whereas
recursion to a depth of roughly n is not.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, binary search can't be used on linked lists.  Think about why.

<p>In Lab 3, you modified several methods in the SList class so that a "tail"
reference could keep track of the end of the list, thereby speeding up the
insertEnd() method.
</p>
<p>
We could have accomplished the same result without modifying SList&ndash;by creating
a new class that inherits all the properties of SList, and then changing only
the methods that need to change.  Let's create a new class called TailList that
inherits the fields and methods of the original SList class.
</p>



<pre class="src src-java"><span style="color: #a020f0;">public</span> <span style="color: #a020f0;">class</span> <span style="color: #228b22;">TailList</span> <span style="color: #a020f0;">extends</span> <span style="color: #228b22;">SList</span> {
  <span style="color: #b22222;">// </span><span style="color: #b22222;">The "head" and "size" fields are inherited from SList.</span>
  <span style="color: #a020f0;">private</span> <span style="color: #228b22;">SListNode</span> <span style="color: #a0522d;">tail</span>;
</pre>


<p>
This code declares a TailList class that behaves just like the SList class, but
has an additional field "tail" not present in the SList class.  TailList is
said to be a <span style="text-decoration:underline;">subclass</span> of SList, and SList is the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">superclass</span> of TailList.
A TailList has three fields:  head, size, and tail.
</p>
<p>
A subclass can modify or augment a superclass in at least three ways:
</p><ol>
<li>It can declare new fields.
</li>
<li>It can declare new methods.
</li>
<li>It can override old methods with new implementations.
</li>
</ol>


<p>
We've already seen an example of the first.  Let's try out the third.  The
advantage of TailList is that it can perform the insertEnd() method much more
quickly than a tail-less SList can.  So, let's write a new insertEnd() for
TailList, which will <span style="text-decoration:underline;">override</span> SList's old, slow insertEnd() method.
</p>

<p>
The isEmpty(), length(), nth(), and toString() methods of SList do not need any
changes on account of the tail reference.  These methods are inherited from
SList, and there's no need to rewrite them.

<p>What happens when we construct a TailList?  Java executes a TailList
constructor, as you would expect, but <span style="text-decoration:underline;">first</span> it executes the code in the
SList() constructor.  The TailList constructor should initialize fields unique
to TailList.  It can also modify the work done by SList() if appropriate.
</p>



<pre class="src src-java"><span style="color: #a020f0;">public</span> TailList() {
  <span style="color: #b22222;">// </span><span style="color: #b22222;">SList() constructor called automatically; sets size = 0, head = null</span>
  tail = <span style="color: #008b8b;">null</span>;
}
</pre>


<p>
The zero-parameter SList() constructor is always called by default, regardless
of the parameters passed to the TailList constructor.  To change this default
behavior, the TailList constructor can explicitly call any constructor for its
superclass by using the "super" keyword.
</p>



<pre class="src src-java"><span style="color: #a020f0;">public</span> TailList(<span style="color: #228b22;">int</span> <span style="color: #a0522d;">x</span>) {
    <span style="color: #a020f0;">super</span>(x);
    tail = <span style="color: #008b8b;">null</span>;
}
</pre>


<p>
The call to "super()" must be the first statement in the constructor.  If a
constructor has no explicit call to "super", and its (nearest) superclass has
no zero-parameter constructor, a compile-time error occurs.  There is no way to
tell Java not to call a superclass constructor.  You have only the power to
choose which of the superclass constructors is called.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-10-4">

<p>I lied when I said that we don't need to modify SList.  One change is
necessary.  The "head" and "size" fields in SList must be declared "protected",
not "private".
</p>



<pre class="src src-java"><span style="color: #a020f0;">public</span> <span style="color: #a020f0;">class</span> <span style="color: #228b22;">SList</span> {

}
</pre>


<p>
"protected" is a level of protection somewhere between "public" and "private".
A "protected" field is visible to the declaring class and all its subclasses,
but not to other classes.  "private" fields aren't even visible to the
subclasses.
</p>
<p>
If "head" and "size" are declared private, the method TailList.insertFront
can't access them and won't compile.  If they're declared protected,
insertFront can access them because TailList is a subclass of SList.
</p>
<p>
When you write an ADT, if you think somebody might someday want to write a
subclass of it, declare its vulnerable fields "protected", unless you have a
reason for not wanting subclasses to see them.  Helper methods often should be
declared "protected" as well.

<p>Here's where inheritance gets interesting.  Any TailList can masquerade as an
SList.  An object of class TailList can be assigned to a variable of type
SList&ndash;but the reverse is not true.  Every TailList is an SList, but not every
SList is a TailList.  It merits repeating:
</p>
<p>
 !!!  <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Every TailList *IS* an SList</span>. !!!   For example:

Memorize the following two definitions.

</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Dynamic type</span>:  The class of the object the variable references.
</li>
</ul>


<p>
In the code above, the static type of s is SList, and the dynamic type of s is
TailList.  Henceforth, I will often just say "type" for static type and "class"
for dynamic type.
</p>
<p>
When we invoke an overridden method, Java calls the method for the object's
<span style="text-decoration:underline;">dynamic</span> type, regardless of the variable's static type.

This is called <span style="text-decoration:underline;">dynamic method lookup</span>, because Java automatically looks up the

Suppose you have a method (in any class) that sorts an SList using only    
SList method calls (but doesn't construct any SLists).  Your method now    
sorts TailLists too, with no changes.

Suppose you've written a class&ndash;let's call it RunLengthEncoding&ndash;that uses 
SLists extensively.  By changing the constructors so that they create      
TailLists instead of SLists, your class immediately realizes the           
performance improvement that TailLists provide&ndash;without changing anything  
else in the RunLengthEncoding class.

<p>
Why?  Because not every object of class SList has an "eatTail()" method, so
Java can't use dynamic method lookup on the variable s.
</p>
<p>
But if we define eatTail() in SList instead, the statements above compile and
run without errors, even if no eatTail() method is defined in class TailList.
(TailList inherits eatTail() from SList.)
</p>
<p>
(2)  I pointed out earlier that you can't assign an SList object to a TailList
variable.  The rules are more complicated when you assign one variable to
another.
</p>



<pre class="src src-java"><span style="color: #228b22;">SList</span> <span style="color: #a0522d;">s</span>;

</pre>


<p>
Why does the compiler reject "t = s", but accept "t = (TailList) s"?  It
refuses "t = s" because not every SList is a TailList, and it wants you to
confirm that you're not making a thoughtless mistake.  The cast in the latter
statement is your way of reassuring the compiler that you've designed the
program to make sure that the SList s will always be a TailList.
</p>
<p>
If you're wrong, Java will find out when you run the program, and will crash
with a "ClassCastException" error message.  The error occurs only at run-time
because Java cannot tell in advance what class of object s will reference.
</p>
<p>
Recall that SLists store items of type Object.  When they're recovered, they
usually have to be cast back to a more specific type before they can be used.
Suppose we have a list of Integers.  Recall that nth() returns type Object.
</p>



<pre class="src src-java"><span style="color: #228b22;">int</span> <span style="color: #a0522d;">x</span> = t.nth(1).intValue();                <span style="color: #b22222;">// </span><span style="color: #b22222;">COMPILE-TIME ERROR.</span>
<span style="color: #228b22;">int</span> <span style="color: #a0522d;">y</span> = ( (<span style="color: #228b22;">Integer</span>) t.nth(1) ).intValue();  <span style="color: #b22222;">// </span><span style="color: #b22222;">Groovy.</span>
</pre>


<p>
Some methods are defined on every Object, though.
</p>



<pre class="src src-java"><span style="color: #228b22;">String</span> <span style="color: #a0522d;">z</span> = t.nth(1).toString();             <span style="color: #b22222;">// </span><span style="color: #b22222;">Groovy.</span>
</pre>


<p>
(3)  Java has an "instanceof" operator that tells you whether an object is of
a specific class.  WARNING:  The "o" in "instanceof" is not capitalized.
</p>



<pre class="src src-java"><span style="color: #a020f0;">if</span> (s <span style="color: #a020f0;">instanceof</span> TailList) {
  t = (<span style="color: #228b22;">TailList</span>) s;

<p>
This instanceof operation will return false if s is null or doesn't reference
a TailList.  It returns true if s references a TailList object&ndash;even if it's
a subclass of TailList.

<h3 id="sec-11-1">equals()</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-11-1">

<p>Every class has an equals() method.  If you don't define one explictly, you
inherit Object.equals(), for which "r1.equals(r2)" returns the same boolean
value as "r1 == r2", where r1 and r2 are references.  However, many classes
override equals() to compare the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">content</span> of two objects.
</p>
<p>
Integer (in the java.lang library) is such a class; it stores one private int.
Two distinct Integer objects are equals() if they contain the same int.
In the following example, "i1 == i2" is false, but "i1.equals(i2)" is true.
"i2 == i3" and "i2.equals(i3)" are both true.
</p>

<p>
<img src="ditaa-images/TEMP_1_75da5d56f2c380500effcf07b8cc9cd780b8e978.png"  alt="ditaa-images/TEMP_1_75da5d56f2c380500effcf07b8cc9cd780b8e978.png" />
</p>

<p>
IMPORTANT:  r1.equals(r2) throws a run-time exception if r1 is null.
</p>
<p>
There are at least four different degrees of equality.
</p><ol>
<li>Reference equality, ==.  (The default inherited from the Object class.)
</li>
<li>Shallow structural equality:  two objects are "equals" if all their fields
     are ==.  For example, two SLists whose "size" fields are equal and whose
     "head" fields point to the same SListNode.
</li>
<li>Deep structural equality:  two objects are "equals" if all their fields
     are "equals".  For example, two SLists that represent the same sequence of
     items (though the SListNodes may be different).
</li>
<li>Logical equality.  Two examples:
      a.  Two "Set" objects are "equals" if they contain the same elements,
          even if the underlying lists store the elements in different orders.
      b.  The Fractions 1/3 and 2/6 are "equals", even though their numerators
          and denominators are all different.
</li>
</ol>


<p>
The equals() method for a particular class may test any of these four levels of
equality, depending on what seems appropriate.  Let's write an equals() method
for SLists that tests for deep structural equality.  The following method
returns true only if the two lists represent identical sequences of items.
</p>

<p>
Note that this implementation may fail if the SList invariants have been
corrupted.  (A wrong "size" field or a loop in an SList can make it fail.)
</p>
<p>
IMPORTANT:  Overriding DOESN'T WORK if we change the signature of the original
method, even just to change a parameter to a subclass.  In the Object class,
the signature is equals(Object), so in the code above, we must declare "other"
to be an Object too.  If we declare "other" to be an SList, the equals() method
will compile but it will NOT override.  That means the code
</p>



<pre class="src src-java"><span style="color: #228b22;">Object</span> <span style="color: #a0522d;">s</span> = <span style="color: #a020f0;">new</span> <span style="color: #228b22;">SList</span>();
s.equals(s);
</pre>


<p>
will call Object.equals(), not SList.equals().  Dynamic method lookup won't
care that s is an SList, because the equals() method above is not eligible to
override Object.equals().
</p>
<p>
Therefore, if you want to override a method, make sure the signature is EXACTLY
the same.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-11-3">

<p>Complex software, like Project 1, is easier to debug if you write lots of test
code.  We'll consider three types of testing:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Modular testing:  testing each method and each class separately.
</li>
<li>Integration testing:  testing a set of methods/classes together.
</li>
<li>Result verification:  testing results for correctness, and testing data
       structures to ensure they still satisfy their invariants.
</li>
</ol>

<div id="outline-container-11-3-1" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-11-3-1">Modular Testing</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-11-3-1">

<p>When you write a program and it fails, it can be quite difficult to determine
which part of the code is responsible.  Even experienced programmers often
guess wrong.  It's wise to test every method you write individually.
</p>
<p>
There are two types of test code for modular testing:  test drivers and stubs.
</p>
<p>
(a)  Test drivers are methods that call the code being tested, then check the
results.  In Lab 3 and Homework 3, you've seen test drivers in the SList class
that check that your code is doing the right thing.
</p>
<p>
Both public and private methods should be tested.  Hence, a test driver usually
needs to be inside the class it tests.  In a class intended for use by other
classes, the obvious place to put a test driver is in the main() method, as we
did in Lab 3 and Homework 3.  However, if a class is the entry point for the
program, you can't put your test driver in main().  Instead, put it in a method
with a name like testDriver(), and then write <span style="text-decoration:underline;">another</span> class whose main()
method calls your test driver.
</p>
<p>
(b)  Stubs are small bits of code that are <span style="text-decoration:underline;">called</span> by the code being tested.
They are often quite short.  They serve three purposes.
</p>
<ol>
<li>If you write a method that calls other methods that haven't yet been
    implemented, you can write simple stubs that fake the missing methods.
</li>
<li>Suppose you are having difficulty determining whether a bug lies in
    a calling method, or a method it calls.  You can temporarily replace the
    callee with a stub that returns controlled results to the caller, so you
    can see if the caller is responsible for the problem.
</li>
<li>Stubs allow you to create repeatable test cases that might not arise often
    in practice.  For instance, suppose a subroutine fetches and returns input
    from an airline database, and your code calls this subroutine.  You might
    want to test whether your code operates correctly when ten airplanes
    depart at the same time.  Such an event might be rare in practice, but you
    can replace the database access subroutine with a stub that feeds fake
    data to your code.  There are two advantages:

<ul>
<li>Stubs can produce test data that the real code rarely or never produces.
</li>
<li>Stubs produce <span style="text-decoration:underline;">repeatable</span> test data, so that bugs can be reproduced.
</li>
</ul>

</li>
</ol>

<div id="outline-container-11-3-2" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-11-3-2">Integration Testing</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-11-3-2">

<p>Integration testing is testing all the components together (preferably <span style="text-decoration:underline;">after</span>
you have tested them in isolation).  Sometimes bugs arise during integration
because your test cases weren't thorough enough.  Other times, they arise
because of misunderstandings about how the components are supposed to interact
with each other.  Integration testing is harder than modular testing, because
it's harder to determine where a bug is, or to identify your mistaken
assumptions about how the components interact.
</p>
<p>
The most important task in avoiding these bugs is to define your interfaces
well and unambiguously.  There should be no ambiguity in the descriptions of
the behavior of your methods, especially in unusual cases.  We'll talk a lot
more about this in later lectures.
</p>
<p>
The best advice I can give on integration testing:  learn to use a debugger.
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-11-3-3" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-11-3-3">Result Verification</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-11-3-3">

<p>A result verifier is a method that checks the results of other methods.  There
are at least two types of result verifiers you can write.
</p>
<ol>
<li>Data structure integrity checkers.  A method can inspect a data structure
    (like a list) and verify that all the invariants are satisfied.  For
    Project 1, we are asking you to write a simple checker named "check()"
    that verifies the integrity of your run-length encodings.
</li>
<li>Algorithm result checkers.  A method can inspect the output of another
    method for correctness.  For example, if a method is supposed to sort an
    array of numbers, a result checker can walk through the output and check
    that each item really is less than or equal to its successor.
</li>
</ol>


<p>
An <span style="text-decoration:underline;">assertion</span> is a piece of code that tests an invariant or a result.
Java offers an "assert" keyword that tests whether an assertion evaluates to
"true".  If the assertion comes up "false", Java terminates the program with an
"AssertionError" error message, a stack trace, and an optional message of your
own choosing.
</p>



<pre class="src src-java"><span style="color: #228b22;">assert</span> <span style="color: #a0522d;">x</span> == 3;
<span style="color: #228b22;">assert</span> list.<span style="color: #a0522d;">size</span> == list.countLength() : <span style="color: #8b2252;">"wrong SList size:  "</span> + list.size;
</pre>


<p>
At the end of each method that changes a data structure, add assertions
(possibly a call to an integrity checker).  At the end of each method that
computes a result, add an assertion that calls a result checker.
</p>
<p>
Assertions are convenient because you can turn them on or off.  To turn them on
when you're testing your code, run your code with "java -ea" (for "enable
assertions").  To turn them off for greater speed, run with "java -da" (for
"disable assertions").  The default (if you specify no switch) is -da.
WARNING:  when assertions are turned off, the method "list.countLength()" above
is never called.  Good for speed, but countLength() must not perform a task
that is necessary for your program's correctness.

<div id="outline-container-11-3-4" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-11-3-4">Regression Testing</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-11-3-4">

<p>A <span style="text-decoration:underline;">regression test</span> is a test suite can be re-run whenever changes are made to
the code.  Nearly every software company has reams of regression tests for each
product.  They run them again every time they fix a bug or add a feature.
</p>
<p>
Some principles of regression testing:
</p>
<ol>
<li>All-paths testing:  your test cases should try to test every path through
     the code.  Test every method.  For every "if" statement, you should try to
     write a test case for each of the two paths.
</li>
<li>"Boundary cases" should be tested, as well as non-boundary cases.  For
     instance, if you write a binary search method, test it on arrays of
     lengths zero and one, as well as longer lengths.  Test the cases where the
     item sought is the first element, the last element, in the middle, not
     present.  For every loop in the code, try to test the cases where it
     iterates zero or one times, as well as the case where it iterates several
     times.  Test the branch "if (x &gt;= 1)" for x equal to 0, 1, and 2.
</li>
<li>Generally, methods can be divided into two types:  extenders, which
     construct or change an object; and observers, which return information
     about an object.  (Some methods do both, but you should always think hard
     about whether that's good design.)  Ideally, your test cases should test
     every combination of extender and observer.
</li>
</ol>


<p>
In real-world software development, the size of the test code is often larger
than the size of the code being tested.

<h3 id="sec-12-1">ABSTRACT CLASSES</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-12-1">

<p>An abstract class is a class whose sole purpose is to be extended.
</p>



<pre class="src src-java"><span style="color: #a020f0;">public</span> <span style="color: #a020f0;">abstract</span> <span style="color: #a020f0;">class</span> <span style="color: #228b22;">List</span> {

  <span style="color: #a020f0;">public</span> <span style="color: #228b22;">int</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">length</span>() {
    <span style="color: #a020f0;">return</span> size;
  }

  <span style="color: #a020f0;">public</span> <span style="color: #a020f0;">abstract</span> <span style="color: #228b22;">void</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">insertFront</span>(<span style="color: #228b22;">Object</span> <span style="color: #a0522d;">item</span>);
}
</pre>


<p>
Abstract classes don't allow you to create objects directly.  You can declare a
variable of type List, but you can't create a List object.
</p>



<pre class="src src-java"><span style="color: #228b22;">List</span> <span style="color: #a0522d;">myList</span>;                 <span style="color: #b22222;">// </span><span style="color: #b22222;">Right on.</span>
myList = <span style="color: #a020f0;">new</span> <span style="color: #228b22;">List</span>();         <span style="color: #b22222;">// </span><span style="color: #b22222;">COMPILE-TIME ERROR.</span>
</pre>


<p>
However, abstract classes can be extended in the same way as ordinary classes,
and the subclasses are usually not abstract.  (They can be, but usually they're
normal subclasses with complete implementations.)
</p>
<p>
The abstract List class above includes an abstract method, insertFront.  An
abstract method lacks an implementation.  One purpose of an abstract method is
to guarantee that every non-abstract subclass will implement the method.
Specifically, every non-abstract subclass of List must have an implementation
for the insertFront method.
</p>



<pre class="src src-java"><span style="color: #a020f0;">public</span> <span style="color: #a020f0;">class</span> <span style="color: #228b22;">SList</span> <span style="color: #a020f0;">extends</span> <span style="color: #228b22;">List</span> {
  <span style="color: #b22222;">// </span><span style="color: #b22222;">inherits the "size" field.</span>
  <span style="color: #a020f0;">protected</span> <span style="color: #228b22;">SListNode</span> <span style="color: #a0522d;">head</span>;

  <span style="color: #b22222;">// </span><span style="color: #b22222;">inherits the "length" method.</span>

  <span style="color: #a020f0;">public</span> <span style="color: #228b22;">void</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">insertFront</span>(<span style="color: #228b22;">Object</span> <span style="color: #a0522d;">item</span>) {
    head = <span style="color: #a020f0;">new</span> <span style="color: #228b22;">SListNode</span>(item, head);
    size++;
  }  
}
</pre>


<p>
If you leave out the implementation of insertFront in SList, the Java compiler
will complain that you must provide one.  A non-abstract class may never
contain an abstract method, nor inherit one without providing an
implementation.
</p>
<p>
Because SList is not abstract, we can create SList objects; and because SLists
are Lists, we can assign an SList to a List variable.
</p>



<pre class="src src-java"><span style="color: #228b22;">List</span> <span style="color: #a0522d;">myList</span> = <span style="color: #a020f0;">new</span> <span style="color: #228b22;">SList</span>();   <span style="color: #b22222;">// </span><span style="color: #b22222;">Right on.</span>
myList.insertFront(obj);     <span style="color: #b22222;">// </span><span style="color: #b22222;">Right on.</span>
</pre>


<p>
What are abstract classes good for?  It's all about the interface.
</p>



<pre class="src src-text">----------------------------------------------------
|  An abstract class lets you define an interface  |
|    - for multiple classes to share,              |
|    - without defining any of them yet.           |
----------------------------------------------------
</pre>


<p>
Let's consider the List class.  Although the List class is abstract, it is an
ADT&ndash;even without any implementation!&ndash; because it has an interface with public
method prototypes and well-defined behaviors.  We can implement an
algorithm&ndash;for example, a list sorter&ndash;based on the List interface, without
ever knowing how the lists will be implemented.  One list sorter can sort every
kind of List.
</p>



<pre class="src src-java"><span style="color: #a020f0;">public</span> <span style="color: #228b22;">void</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">listSort</span>(<span style="color: #228b22;">List</span> <span style="color: #a0522d;">l</span>) { ... }
</pre>


<p>
In another part of the universe, your project partners can build lots of
subclasses of List:  SList, DList, TailList, and so on.  They can also build
special-case List subclasses: for example, a TimedList that records the amount
of time spent doing List operations, and a TransactionList that logs all
changes made to the list on a disk so that all information can be recovered if
a power outage occurs.  A library catalogue application that uses DLists can
send them to your listSort algorithm to be sorted.  An airline flight database
that uses TransactionLists can send them to you for sorting, too, and you don't
have to change a line of sorting code.  You may have written your list sorter
years before TransactionLists were ever thought of.
</p>


<p>
The list sorter is built on the foundation of a list  
ADT, and the application is built on the foundation of
the list sorter.  However, it's the application, and  
not the list sorter, that gets to choose what kind of 
list is actually used, and thereby obtains special    
features like transaction logging.  This is a big     
advantage of object-oriented languages like Java.

<h3 id="sec-12-2">JAVA INTERFACES</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-12-2">

<p>Java has an "interface" keyword which refers to something quite different than
the interfaces I defined in Lecture 8, even though the two interfaces are
related.  Henceforth, when I say "interfaces" I mean public fields, public
method prototypes, and the behaviors of public methods.  When I say "Java
interfaces" I mean Java's "interface" keyword.
</p>
<p>
A Java interface is just like an abstract class, except for two differences.
</p><ol>
<li>In Java, a class can inherit from only one class, even if the superclass
     is an abstract class.  However, a class can "implement" (inherit from) as
     many Java interfaces as you like.
</li>
<li>A Java interface cannot implement any methods, nor can it include any
     fields except "final static" constants.  It only contains method
     prototypes and constants.
</li>
</ol>





<pre class="src src-java"><span style="color: #a020f0;">public</span> <span style="color: #a020f0;">interface</span> <span style="color: #228b22;">Nukeable</span> {               <span style="color: #b22222;">// </span><span style="color: #b22222;">In Nukeable.java</span>

  }
}
</pre>


<p>
Observe that the method prototypes in a Java interface may be declared without
the "abstract" keyword, because it would be redundant; a Java interface cannot
contain a method implementation.
</p>
<p>
The distinction between abstract classes and Java interfaces exists because of
technical reasons that you might begin to understand if you take CS 164
(Compilers).  Some languages, like C++, allow "multiple inheritance," so that a
subclass can inherit from several superclasses.  Java does not allow multiple
inheritance in its full generality, but it offers a sort of crippled form of
multiple inheritance:  a class can "implement" multiple Java interfaces.
</p>
<p>
Why does Java have this limitation?  Multiple inheritance introduces a lot of
problems in both the definition of a language and the efficient implementation
of a language.  For example, what should we do if a class inherits from two
different superclasses two different methods or fields with the same name?
Multiple inheritance is responsible for some of the scariest tricks and traps
of the C++ language, subtleties that cause much wailing and gnashing of teeth.
Java interfaces don't have these problems.
</p>
<p>
Because an SList is a Nukeable and a Comparable, we can assign it to variables
of these types.
</p>



<pre class="src src-java"><span style="color: #228b22;">Nukeable</span> <span style="color: #a0522d;">n</span> = <span style="color: #a020f0;">new</span> <span style="color: #228b22;">SList</span>();
<span style="color: #228b22;">Comparable</span> <span style="color: #a0522d;">c</span> = (<span style="color: #228b22;">Comparable</span>) n;
</pre>


<p>
The cast is required because not every Nukeable is a Comparable.
</p>
<p>
"Comparable" is a standard interface in the Java library.  By having a class
implement Comparable, you immediately gain access to Java's sorting library.
For instance, the Arrays class in java.util includes a method that sorts arrays
of Comparable objects.
</p>



<pre class="src src-java"><span style="color: #a020f0;">public</span> <span style="color: #a020f0;">static</span> <span style="color: #228b22;">void</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">sort</span>(<span style="color: #228b22;">Object</span>[] <span style="color: #a0522d;">a</span>)       <span style="color: #b22222;">// </span><span style="color: #b22222;">In java.util</span>
</pre>


<p>
The parameter's type is Object[], but a run-time error will occur if any item
stored in a is not a Comparable.
</p>
<p>
Interfaces can be extended with subinterfaces.  A subinterface can have
multiple superinterfaces, so we can group several interfaces into one.
</p>



<pre class="src src-java"><span style="color: #a020f0;">public</span> <span style="color: #a020f0;">interface</span> <span style="color: #228b22;">NukeAndCompare</span> <span style="color: #a020f0;">extends</span> <span style="color: #228b22;">Nukeable</span>, <span style="color: #228b22;">Comparable</span> { }
</pre>


<p>
We could also add more method prototypes and constants, but in this example
I don't.

<p>
Every Java program implicitly imports java.lang.*, so you don't have to import
it explicitly to use System.out.println().  However, if you import packages
that contain multiple classes with the same name, you'll need to qualify their
names explicitly throughout your code.
</p>



<pre class="src src-java"><span style="color: #008b8b;">java</span>.<span style="color: #008b8b;">awt</span>.Frame.add(<span style="color: #008b8b;">photo</span>.Frame.canvas);
</pre>


<p>
Any package you create must appear in a directory of the same name.  For
example, the photo.Frame class bytecode appears in photo/Frame.class, and
x.y.z.Class appears in x/y/z/Class.class.  Where are the photo and x
directories?  They can appear in any of the directories on your "classpath".
You can specify a classpath on the command line, as when you type
</p>



<pre class="src src-java">javac -cp <span style="color: #8b2252;">".:~jrs/classes:libraries.jar"</span> *.java
</pre>


<p>
This means that Java first looks in ".", the current directory, then looks in
~jrs/classes/, then finally in the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Java archive</span> libraries.jar when it's
looking for the photo and x directories.  The classpath does not include the
location of the Java standard library packages (those beginning with java or
javax).  The Java compiler knows where to find them.

}                                    |  }
</pre>


<p>
Here, the SListNode class and its fields are marked neither public, private,
nor protected.  Instead, they have "package" protection, which falls somewhere
between "private" and "protected".  Package protection is specified not by
using the word "package", but by using no modifier at all.  Variables are
package by default unless declared public, private, or protected.
</p>
<p>
A class or variable with package protection is visible to any class in the same
package, but not to classes outside the package (i.e., files outside the
directory).  The files in a package are presumed to trust each other, and are
usually implemented by the same person.  Files outside the package can only see
the public classes, methods, and fields.  (Subclasses outside the package can
see the protected methods and fields as well.)
</p>
<p>
Before we knew about packages, we had to make the fields of SListNode public so
that SList could manipulate them.  Our list package above solves this problem
by giving SListNode and its fields package protection, so that the SList class
may use SListNodes freely, but outside applications cannot access them.
</p>
<p>
In Homework 4, you'll see a different approach.  There, the DListNode class is
public, so that DListNodes can be directly held by application programs, but
the "prev" and "next" fields have package protection, so an application cannot
access these fields or corrupt the DList ADT.  But an application can hop
quickly from node to node because it can store DListNode references and use
them as parameters in DList method calls.
</p>
<p>
Each public class must be declared in a file named after the class, but a class
with package protection can be declared in any .java file (usually found
together with a class that uses it).  So a public SList class and a package
SListNode class can both be declared in the file list/SList.java, if you feel
like it.
</p>
<p>
Compiling and running files in a package is a bit tricky, because it must be
done from outside the package, using the following syntax:
</p>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-13-2">

<p>In java.util there is a standard Java interface for iterating over sequences of
objects.
</p>



<pre class="src src-java"><span style="color: #a020f0;">public</span> <span style="color: #a020f0;">interface</span> <span style="color: #228b22;">Iterator</span> {
  <span style="color: #228b22;">boolean</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">hasNext</span>();
  <span style="color: #228b22;">Object</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">next</span>();

}
</pre>


<p>
Part of Project 1 is to write a class RunIterator that implements an Iterator
for your RunLengthEncoding class.  Its purpose is to provide an interface by
which other classes can read the runs in your run-length encoding, one by one.
</p>
<p>
An Iterator is like a bookmark.  Just as you can have many bookmarks in a book,
you can have many Iterators iterating over the same data structure, each one
independent of the others.  One Iterator can advance without disturbing other
Iterators that are iterating over the same data structure.
</p>
<p>
The first time next() is called on a newly constructed Iterator, it returns the
first item in the sequence.  Each subsequent time next() is called, it returns
the next item in the sequence.  After the Iterator has returned every item in
the sequence, every subsequent call to next() throws an exception and halts
with an error message.  (I find this annoying; I would prefer an interface in
which next() returns null.  The Java library designers disagree.)
</p>
<p>
To help you avoid triggering an exception, hasNext() returns true if the
Iterator has more items to return, or false if it has already returned every
item in the sequence.  It is usually considered good practice to check
hasNext() before calling next().  (In the next lecture we'll learn how to catch
exceptions; that will give us an alternative way to prevent our program from
crashing when next() throws an exception.)
</p>
<p>
There is usually no way to reset an Iterator back to the beginning of the
sequence.  Instead, you construct a new Iterator.
</p>
<p>
Most data structures that support Iterators "implement" another interface in
java.util called "Iterable".  
</p>



<pre class="src src-java"><span style="color: #a020f0;">public</span> <span style="color: #a020f0;">interface</span> <span style="color: #228b22;">Iterable</span> {
  <span style="color: #228b22;">Iterator</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">iterator</span>();
}
</pre>


<p>
It is customary for applications that want to iterate over a data structure DS
to call DS.iterate(), which constructs and returns a DSIterator whose fields
are initialized so it is ready to return the first item in DS.
</p>
<p>
A benefit of creating an Iterable class with its own Iterator is that Java has
a simple built-in loop syntax, a second kind of "for each" loop, that iterates
over the items in a data structure.  Suppose we design an SList that implements
Iterator.  The following loop (which can appear in any class) iterates through
the items in an SList l.
</p>



<pre class="src src-java">  <span style="color: #a020f0;">for</span> (<span style="color: #228b22;">Object</span> <span style="color: #a0522d;">o</span> : l) {
    System.out.println(o);
  }

This loop is <span style="color: #228b22;">equivalent</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">to</span>

  <span style="color: #a020f0;">for</span> (<span style="color: #228b22;">Iterator</span> <span style="color: #a0522d;">i</span> = l.iterator(); i.hasNext(); ) {
    <span style="color: #228b22;">Object</span> <span style="color: #a0522d;">o</span> = i.next();
    System.out.println(o);
  }
</pre>


<p>
To make all this more concrete, here is a complete implementation of an
SListIterator class and a partial implementation of SList, both in the "list"
package.

<p>
Observe that an Iterator may mess up or even crash the program if the
structure it is iterating over changes.  For example, if the node "n" that an
SListIterator references is removed from the list, the SListIterator will not
be able to find the rest of the nodes.
</p>
<p>
An Iterator doesn't have to iterate over a data structure.  For example, you
can implement an Iterator subclass called Primes that returns each successive
prime number as an Integer object.

Exception), and you can prevent the error message from printing and the program

<p>
What does this code do?
</p><ol>
<li>It executes the code inside the "try" braces.
</li>
<li>If the "try" code executes normally, we skip over the "catch" clauses.
</li>
<li>If the "try" code throws an exception, Java does not finish the "try"
     code.  It jumps directly to the first "catch" clause that matches the
     exception, and executes that "catch" clause.  By "matches", I mean that
     the actual exception object thrown is the same class as, or a subclass of,
     the static type listed in the "catch" clause.

<p>
     When the "catch" clause finishes executing, Java jumps to the next line of
     code immediately after all the "catch" clauses.
</p></li>
</ol>


<p>
The code within a "catch" clause is called an <span style="text-decoration:underline;">exception handler</span>.
</p>
<p>
If the FileInputStream constructor fails to find the file, it will throw a
FileNotFoundException.  The line "i = f.read()" is not executed; execution
jumps directly to the first exception handler.
</p>
<p>
FileNotFoundException is a subclass of IOException, so the exception matches
both "catch" clauses.  However, only one "catch" clause is executed&ndash;the first
one that matches.  The second "catch" clause would execute if the first were
not present.
</p>
<p>
If the FileInputStream constructor runs without error, but the read() method
throws an exception (for instance, because a disk track is faulty), it 
typically generates some sort of IOException that isn't a FileNotFoundException.
This causes the second "catch" clause to execute and close the file.  Exception
handlers are often used to recover from errors and clean up loose ends like
open files.
</p>
<p>
Note that you don't need a "catch" clause for every exception that can occur.
You can catch some exceptions and let others propagate.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-14-1-2">

<p>Believe it or not, you might want to throw your own exception.  Exceptions are
the easiest way to move program execution out of a method whose purpose has
been defeated.
</p>
<p>
For example, suppose you're writing a parser that reads Java code and analyzes
its syntactic structure.  Parsers are quite complicated, and use many recursive
calls and loops.  Suppose that your parser is executing a method many methods
deep within the program stack within many levels of loop nesting.  Suddenly,
your parser unexpectedly reaches the end of the file, because a student
accidentally erased the last 50 lines of his program.
</p>
<p>
It's quite painful to write code that elegantly retraces its way back up
through the method calls and loops when a surprise happens deep within a
parser.  A better solution?  Throw an exception!  You can even roll your own.
</p>

</pre>


<p>
This class doesn't have any methods except the default constructor.  There's no
need; the only purpose of a ParserException is to be distinguishable from other
types of exceptions.  Now we can write some parser methods.
</p>



<pre class="src src-java"><span style="color: #a020f0;">public</span> <span style="color: #228b22;">ParseTree</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">parseExpression</span>() <span style="color: #a020f0;">throws</span> <span style="color: #228b22;">ParserException</span> {

    [more code]
        }
}
<span style="color: #a020f0;">return</span> pt;
}
</pre>


<p>
The "throw" statement throws a ParserException, thereby immediately getting us
out of the routine.  How is this different from a "return" statement?  First,
we don't have to return anything.  Second, an exception can propagate several
stack frames down the stack, not just one, as we'll see shortly.
</p>
<p>
The method signature has the modifier "throws ParserException".  This is
necessary; Java won't let you compile the method without it.  "throws" clauses
help you and the compiler keep track of which exceptions can propagate where.

<p>
The parse() method above shows how to define a method that can throw two (or
more) exceptions.  Since every exception is a subclass of Exception, we could
have replaced the two exceptions with "Exception", but then the caller would
have to catch all types of Exceptions.  We don't want (in this case) to catch
NullPointerExceptions or otherwise hide our bugs from ourselves.
</p>
<p>
When parseExpression() throws an exception, it propagates right through the
calling method parse() and down to compile(), where it is caught.  compile()
doesn't need a "throws ParserException" clause because it catches any
ParserException that can occur.  In this code, the "catch" clauses don't do
anything except stop the exceptions.
</p>
<p>
If an exception propagates all the way out of main() without being caught, the
JVM prints an error message and halts.  You've seen this happen many times.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-14-2">


<p>
The top-level class of things you can "throw" and "catch" is called Throwable.
Here's part of the Throwable class hierarchy.
</p>



<pre class="src src-text">                           Throwable
                          /         \
                         /           \
                        /             \
                       /               \
                      /                 \
             Exception                   Error
            /    \                      /     \
 IOException  RunTimeException AssertionError  VirtualMachineError
               /            \                           \
NullPointerException  ClassCastException              OutOfMemoryError
</pre>


<p>
An Error generally represents a fatal error, like running out of memory or
stack space.  Failed "assert" statements also generate a subclass of Error
called an AssertionError.  Although you can throw or catch any kind of
Throwable, catching an Error is rarely appropriate.
</p>
<p>
Most Exceptions, unlike Errors, signify problems you could conceivably recover
from.  The subclass RunTimeException is made up of exceptions that might be
thrown by the Java Virtual Machine, such as NullPointerException,
ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, and ClassCastException.
</p>
<p>
There are two types of Throwables.  <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Unchecked</span> Throwables are those a method
can throw without declaring them in a "throws" clause.  All Errors and
RunTimeExceptions (including all their subclasses) are unchecked, because
almost every method can generate them inadvertently, and it would be silly if
we had to declare them.
</p>
<p>
All Exceptions except RunTimeExceptions are <span style="text-decoration:underline;">checked</span>, which means that if your
method might throw one without catching it, it must declare that possibility in
a "throws" clause.  Examples of checked exceptions include IOException and
almost any Throwable subclass you would make yourself.
</p>
<p>
When a method calls another method that can throw a checked exception, it has
just two choices.
</p>
<ol>
<li>It can catch the exception, or
</li>
<li>it must be declared so that it "throws" the same exception itself.
</li>
</ol>


<p>
The easiest way to figure out which exceptions to declare is to declare none
and let the compiler's error messages tell you.  (This won't work on the exams,
though.)

    <span style="color: #a020f0;">return</span> 2;
} <span style="color: #a020f0;">finally</span> {
    f.close();
}
</pre>


<p>
If the "try" statement begins to execute, the "finally" clause will be executed
at the end, no matter what happens.  "finally" clauses are used to do things
that need to be done in both normal and exceptional circumstances.
In this example, it is used to close a file.
</p>
<p>
If statementX causes no exception, then the "finally" clause is executed, and
1 is returned.
</p>
<p>
If statementX causes a IOException, the exception is caught, the "catch"
clause is executed, and then the "finally" clause is executed.  After the
"finally" clause is done, 2 is returned.
</p>
<p>
If statementX causes some other class of exception, the "finally" clause is
executed immediately, then the exception continues to propagate down the stack.
</p>
<p>
In the example above, we've invoked the method "printStackTrace" on the
exception we caught.  When an exception is constructed, it takes a snapshot of
the stack, which can be printed later.
</p>
<p>
It is possible for an exception to occur in a "catch" or "finally" clause.  An
exception thrown in a "catch" clause will terminate the "catch" clause, but the
"finally" clause will still get executed before the exception goes on.  An
exception thrown in a "finally" clause replaces the old exception, and
terminates the "finally" clause and the method immediately.
</p>
<p>
However&hellip;you can nest a "try" clause inside a "catch" or "finally" clause,
thereby catching those exceptions as well.

<p>
The error message will be printed if it propagates out of main(), and it can be
read by the Throwable.getMessage() method.  The constructors usually call the

<h3 id="sec-15-2">GENERICS</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-15-2">

<p>Suppose you're using a list of Objects to store Strings.  When you fetch a
String from the list, you have to cast it back to type "String" before you can
call the methods exclusive to Strings.  If somehow an object that's not a
String got into your list, the cast will throw an exception.  It would be nice
to have the compiler enforce the restriction that nothing but Strings can ever
get into your list in the first place, so you can sleep at night knowing that
your family is safe from a ClassCastException.
</p>
<p>
So Java offers <span style="text-decoration:underline;">generics</span>, which allow you to declare general classes that
produce specialized objects.  For example, you can create an SList for Strings
only, and another SList for Integers only, even though you only wrote one
SList class.  To specify the class, SList takes a <span style="text-decoration:underline;">type parameter</span>.
</p>



<pre class="src src-java"><span style="color: #a020f0;">class</span> <span style="color: #228b22;">SListNode</span>&lt;T&gt; {                         <span style="color: #b22222;">// </span><span style="color: #b22222;">T is the formal parameter.</span>
    <span style="color: #228b22;">T</span> <span style="color: #a0522d;">item</span>;
    SListNode&lt;T&gt; next;

    SListNode(<span style="color: #228b22;">T</span> <span style="color: #a0522d;">i</span>, SListNode&lt;T&gt; n) {
        item = i;
        next = n;
    }
}

<span style="color: #a020f0;">public</span> <span style="color: #a020f0;">class</span> <span style="color: #228b22;">SList</span>&lt;T&gt; {
    SListNode&lt;T&gt; head;

    <span style="color: #a020f0;">public</span> <span style="color: #228b22;">void</span> <span style="color: #a0522d;">insertFront</span>(<span style="color: #228b22;">T</span> <span style="color: #a0522d;">item</span>) {
        head = <span style="color: #a020f0;">new</span> <span style="color: #228b22;">SListNode</span>&lt;T&gt;(item, head);
    }
}
</pre>


<p>
You can now create and use an SList of Strings as follows.
</p>



<pre class="src src-java">SList&lt;String&gt; l = <span style="color: #a020f0;">new</span> <span style="color: #228b22;">SList</span>&lt;String&gt;();     <span style="color: #b22222;">// </span><span style="color: #b22222;">String is the actual parameter.</span>
l.insertFront(<span style="color: #8b2252;">"Hello"</span>);
</pre>


<p>
Likewise, you can create an SList of Integers by using "SList&lt;Integer&gt;" in the
declaration and constructor.
</p>
<p>
What are the advantages of generics?  First, the compiler will ensure at
compile-time that nothing but Strings can ever enter your SList&lt;String&gt;.
Second, you don't have to cast the Objects coming out of your SList back to
Strings, so there is no chance of an unexpected ClassCastException at run time.
If some bug in your program is trying to put Integer objects into your SList,
it's much easier to diagnose the compiler refusing to put an Integer into an
SList&lt;String&gt; than it is to diagnose a ClassCastException occurring when you
remove an Integer from a regular SList and try to cast it to String.
</p>
<p>
Generics are a complicated subject.  Consider this to be a taste of them;
hardly a thorough treatment.  A good tutorial is available at
<a href="https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis1xx/resources/generics-tutorial.pdf">https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis1xx/resources/generics-tutorial.pdf</a> .
</p>
<p>
Although Java generics are superficially similar to C++ templates, there's a
crucial difference between them.  In the example above, Java compiles bytecode
for only a single SList class.  This SList bytecode can be used by all
different object types.  It is the compiler, not the bytecode itself, that
enforces the fact that a particular SList object can only store objects of a
particular class.  Conversely, C++ recompiles the SList methods for every type
that you instantiate SLists on.  The C++ disadvantage is that one class might
turn into a lot of machine code.  The C++ advantages are that you can use
primitive types, and you get code optimized for each type.  Java generics don't
work with primitive types.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-15-3">

<p>Just as methods can be overridden in subclasses, fields can be "shadowed" in
subclasses.  However, shadowing works quite differently from overriding.
Whereas the choice of methods is dictated by the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">dyanamic type</span> of an object,
the choice of fields is dictated by the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">static type</span> of a variable or object.
</p>

        <span style="color: #a020f0;">return</span> 4;
    }
}
</pre>


<p>
Any object of class Sub now has <span style="text-decoration:underline;">two</span> fields called x, each of which store a
different integer.  How do we know which field is accessed when we refer to x?
It depends on the static type of the expression whose x field is accessed.
</p>



<pre class="src src-java"><span style="color: #228b22;">Sub</span> <span style="color: #a0522d;">sub</span> = <span style="color: #a020f0;">new</span> <span style="color: #228b22;">Sub</span>();

</pre>


<p>
The last four statements all use the same object, but yield different results.
Recall that method overriding does not work the same way.  Since both variables
reference a Sub, the method Sub.f always overrides Super.f.
</p>



<pre class="src src-java">i = supe.f();           <span style="color: #b22222;">// </span><span style="color: #b22222;">4</span>

i = ((<span style="color: #228b22;">Sub</span>) supe).f();   <span style="color: #b22222;">// </span><span style="color: #b22222;">4</span>
</pre>


<p>
What if the variable whose shadowed field you want to access is "this"?
You can cast "this" too, but a simpler alternative is to replace "this" with
"super".
</p>



<pre class="src src-java"><span style="color: #a020f0;">class</span> <span style="color: #228b22;">Sub</span> <span style="color: #a020f0;">extends</span> <span style="color: #228b22;">Super</span> {

    }
}
</pre>


<p>
Whereas method overriding is a powerful benefit of object orientation, field
shadowing is largely a nuisance.  Whenever possible, avoid having fields in
subclasses whose names are the same as fields in their superclasses.
</p>
<p>
Static methods can be shadowed too; they follow the same shadowing rules as
fields.  This might seem confusing:  why do ordinary, non-static methods use
one system (overriding) while static methods use an entirely different system
(shadowing)?  The reason is because overriding requires dynamic method lookup.
Dynamic method lookup looks up the dynamic type of an object.  A static method
is not called on an object, so there's nothing whose dynamic type we can look
up.  Therefore, static methods <span style="text-decoration:underline;">can't</span> use dynamic method lookup or overriding.
So they use shadowing instead.

<p>
Static method shadowing, like field shadowing, is largely a nuisance.

<p>Doug Whole, a programmer at a Silicon Valley startup, implements a singly-
linked list much like the one you used in Homework 3, but all its fields are
public.  Doug also writes application code that uses linked lists.  One day,
Doug needs to write code that splices the second node out of a list.  It would
only take one line, and he doesn't foresee ever needing to use the same
operation anywhere else.  Being lazy, Doug doesn't feel like adding a new
method to the List class.  Instead, he just does the work directly.
</p>

<p>
Two years later, another programmer, Jeannie Yess, decides to improve the speed
of their list data structure.  After careful thought, she decides to reprogram
the List class so that it uses doubly-linked lists internally.  A "previous"
field is added to ListNode, and the List methods are rewritten.
</p>
<p>
Jeannie tests her new List implementation extensively, and can find no bugs.
But when she replaces Doug's List class with her own, the company's landmark
ListMangler application repeatedly produces the wrong results.  After two long
days of debugging, Jeannie discovers the culprit:  Doug's single line of code.
</p>
<p>
This kind of bug is one of the most difficult to find and fix.  It's also very
common in commercial software systems, and it can have far-reaching effects.
</p>
<p>
You see, Doug's line of code is not the only one that reads or modifies the
list data structure directly.  Jeannie still has to debug 100,000 lines of
Doug's code in other failing applications, as well as 500,000 lines more
written by other programmers who also directly manipulated ListNodes.  The List
improvement project is abandoned.

Other attempts to access the internals of the module    
or ADT are outlawed.

</p>
<p>
Why encapsulation is your friend:
</p><ol>
<li>The implementation is independent of the functionality.  A programmer
       who has the documentation of the interface can implement a new version
       of the module or ADT independently.  A new, better implementation can
       replace an old one.
</li>
<li>Encapsulation prevents Doug from writing applications that corrupt a
       module's internal data.  In real-world programming, encapsulation
       reduces debugging time.  A lot.
</li>
<li>ADTs can guarantee that their invariants are preserved.
</li>
<li>Teamwork.  Once you've rigorously defined interfaces between modules,
       each programmer can independently implement a module without having
       access to the other modules.  A large, complex programming project can
       be broken up into dozens of pieces.
</li>
<li>Documentation and maintainability.  By defining an unambiguous
       interface, you make it easier for other programmers to fix bugs that
       arise years after you've left the company.  Many bugs are a result of
       unforeseen interactions between modules.  If there's a clear
       specification of each interface and each module's behavior, bugs are
       easier to trace.
</li>
<li>When your Project 2 doesn't work, it will be easier to figure out which
       teammate to blame.
</li>
</ol>


<p>
An interface is a CONTRACT between module writers, specifying exactly how they
will communicate.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-17-1-3">

<p>Many languages offer only one construct for enforcing the encapsulation of
ADTs:  self-discipline.
</p>
<p>
As we've seen, Java offers facilities that fortify your self-discipline,
especially Java packages and the "private", package, and "protected" modifiers
for field and method declarations.
</p>
<p>
Java's facilities aren't always enough, though.  There are circumstances in
which you'll want to have multiple modules in the same package.  For instance,
in Project 2 it would be reasonable to put all your modules in the "player"
package.  If you do that, you'll have to fall back on self-discipline.  This
means defining your modules and interfaces before you start programming, and
resisting the temptation to let one module snoop through or change another
module's data structures.
</p>
<p>
One way to find this self-discipline is, wherever one module uses another, to
have a different team member work on each module.  If neither team member
reveals their code to the other, it's much harder to yield to temptation.

<h3 id="sec-17-2">Modules and Interfaces in Project 2</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-17-2">

<p>In Project 2, you are required to divide the programming task into modules,
define interfaces between them, and document these interfaces in your GRADER
file, before you start programming.  This will allow you to work as a team.
</p>
<p>
The game-playing program you will write for      
Project 2 can easily be broken down into a       
number of modules.  Four likely examples are     
illustrated at right.  Your MachinePlayer, its   
game tree search (with alpha-beta pruning), the  
board evaluation function, and the module that   
identifies winning networks can all be           
implemented completely independently, even       
though they will ultimately work together.       
</p>

<p>
<img src="ditaa-images/TEMP_1_40efda33cce82c3521ddf9b07369c28f84b0691a.png"  alt="ditaa-images/TEMP_1_40efda33cce82c3521ddf9b07369c28f84b0691a.png" />
</p>

<p>                                                 
You should probably break your MachinePlayer     
down into a few more modules than this (the      
project README gives a few more suggestions), but
don't try to break it up too much.  You will     
reach a point where it is no longer possible to  
subdivide any module into pieces that are
independent and communicate through <span style="text-decoration:underline;">simple</span> interfaces.
</p>
<p>
You might still be confused:  what exactly <span style="text-decoration:underline;">is</span> a module?  It's a collection of
methods that provide some functionality through a single (hopefully elegant)
interface.  The main difference between a module and a class is this:
</p>
<ul>
<li>A <span style="text-decoration:underline;">module</span> is organized around the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">functionality</span> it provides.
</li>
<li>A <span style="text-decoration:underline;">class</span> is organized around a <span style="text-decoration:underline;">data storage unit</span>.  (Remember that an
    object is a repository of data.)
</li>
</ul>


<p>
The concept of modules is a bit abstract for several reasons.
</p>
<ul>
<li>A module can be made up of several classes, or a class could be made up of
    several modules.  Module boundaries and class boundaries can be independent
    of each other.
      o Why would a module have several classes?  Because it might implement
        a data structure made up of several classes of objects.  For example,
        a List ADT has a list object and node objects.  A Graph ADT has a graph
        object, vertices, and edges.
      o Why would a class have several modules?  Because a single class of
        object might support many independent operations.  The game tree search
        and the evaluation function above both operate on a Network game board,
        but they are independent enough of each other that you could change
        the implementation of one without changing the other.  (Of course, if
        you change the way a game board is represented, you'll have to change
        both implementations.)
</li>
<li>A module may include many methods, or as few as one.  (But not every method
    needs its own module!)
</li>
<li>A package may contain one module or many.
</li>
</ul>


<p>
For Project 2, you should document your modules and interfaces as follows.
</p>
<ul>
<li>List the modules.
</li>
<li>For each module, specify its interface.
      o Recall that an interface includes the prototype(s) for the methods by
        which the module can be called.  This list does not necessarily include
        all the methods in the module!  It only includes the methods that are
        available for <span style="text-decoration:underline;">external</span> callers (outside the module).
      o An interface also includes, for each prototype, a comment that
        describes precisely the module's behavior from an <span style="text-decoration:underline;">external</span> observer's
        point of view.  Your description does not need to state how the module
        is implemented, though.  For instance, a module that does game tree
        search should say that it returns a good, legal move, but it does not
        need to say that it does alpha-beta pruning.  (It's not forbidden to
        say this, though.)  Likewise, you should state that the "network
        identifier" determines whether a game board contains a winning network
        for a given player, but the interface does not need to specify what
        algorithm is used to look for winning networks.  (A description of the
        algorithm should be included in the comments <span style="text-decoration:underline;">in</span> the implementation,
        but it is not part of the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">interface</span>.)  
      o The behavior comment should also describe, for each prototype, every
        parameter and the return value (if any), and how they are interpreted.
        Here you are making a <span style="text-decoration:underline;">contract</span> that your module will speak a certain
        language when it communicates with external callers.
</li>
</ul>


<p>
Here's a short example of an interface you might put in your GRADER file.
(You are not required to implement it this way; this is just an example.
Other modules will probably require longer behavioral descriptions.)
</p>

</pre>


<p>
Your description of how a module behaves should be complete and unambiguous,
and should take into account unusual and erroneous inputs and circumstances.
(It's sometimes okay if your module doesn't handle an erroneous input well, but
you should document that.)  When you and your partners are writing the
interfaces for each module, think carefully about whether you believe these
interfaces will really allow all the modules to do everything they need to do.
</p>
<p>
When you design your interfaces, they should appear (prototypes and behavioral
descriptions both) in both the GRADER file and in the code itself.  Once
you've finished, decide which team members will implement which modules, and
start programming.
</p>
<p>
You may find your team returning to modify the interfaces after a first attempt
at programming, but that's okay.  Just be sure to change the documentation (in
both GRADER and the code comments) to reflect your new design decisions.
</p>
<p>
I recommend you write a draft of your interfaces this week so you'll have lots
of time to program.  The interfaces in the GRADER file are worth 10% of your
project score.  You will need to show them to your TA next week in Lab 8.

<h3 id="sec-18-1">ENCAPSULATED LISTS (a case study in encapsulation)</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-18-1">

<p>Homeworks 3, 4, and 5 introduced you to three different implementations of
linked lists, each fundamentally different.
</p>
<p>
With the Homework 3 lists, if an application writer wants to query the identity
of every item in the list without modifying the list, it takes time
proportional to the square of n, the number of items in the list (i.e.,
Theta(n<sup>2</sup>) time), because you have to use nth(i) to identify each item in time
proportional to i.
</p>
<p>
The lists in Homeworks 4 and 5 allow an application to directly hold a node in
a list.  By alternating between the next() method and the item field or method,
you can query all the list's items in Theta(n) time.  Similarly, if an
application holds a node in the middle of a list, it can insert or delete c
items there in time proportional to c, no matter how long the list is.
</p>
<p>
The Homework 5 lists (SList and DList) are well-encapsulated, whereas the
Homework 4 DList has flaws.  I will discuss these flaws today to illustrate why
designing the really good list ADTs of Homework 5 was tricky.  Let's ask some
questions about how lists should behave.
</p>
<ol>
<li>What happens if we invoke l.remove(n)&ndash;but the node n is in a different
     list than l?

<p>
     In Homework 4, Part II asks whether it is possible for an application to
     break the DList invariants.  One way to do this is to mismatch nodes and
     lists in method calls.  When an application does this, the "size" field of
     the wrong list is updated, thereby breaking the invariant that a list's
     size field should be correct.  How can we fix this?
</p>
<p>
     ADT interface answer:  The methods remove(), insertAfter(), etc. should
     always update the right list's "size" field.
</p>
<p>
     Implementation answer:  It's unacceptably slow to walk through a whole
     list just to see if the node n is really in the list l.  Instead, every
     node should keep a reference to the list that contains it.  In Homework 5,
     each ListNode has a "myList" field.
</p>
</li>
<li>Should insertAfter(), remove(), etc. be methods of List or ListNode?

<p>
     Normally, we expect the methods that modify a data structure (like a List)
     to be methods within that data structure's class.  However, if we define
     methods like insertAfter() and remove() in the ListNode class, rather than
     the List class, we completely avoid the question of what happens if
     they're invoked for a node that's not in "this" list.  This way, the
     interface is more elegant.
</p>
<p>
     ADT interface answer:  the list methods are divided among List and
     ListNode.
</p></li>
</ol>





<pre class="src src-java">Some methods <span style="color: #228b22;">of</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">List</span>                  | Some methods of ListNode
                                      |
<span style="color: #a020f0;">public</span> <span style="color: #228b22;">boolean</span> isEmpty()              | <span style="color: #a020f0;">public</span> Object item()
<span style="color: #a020f0;">public</span> <span style="color: #228b22;">void</span> insertFront(<span style="color: #228b22;">Object</span> <span style="color: #a0522d;">item</span>)  | <span style="color: #a020f0;">public</span> ListNode next()               
<span style="color: #a020f0;">public</span> ListNode front()               | <span style="color: #a020f0;">public</span> <span style="color: #228b22;">void</span> insertAfter(<span style="color: #228b22;">Object</span> <span style="color: #a0522d;">item</span>) 
</pre>


<p>
     Implementation answer:  again, each node has a "myList" field so we can
     update a list's "size" field when we call n.remove(), n.insertAfter(),
     etc.
</p>
<ol>
<li>What happens if we invoke l.remove(n), then l.insertAfter(i, n)?

<p>
     Another way to trash the DList invariants is to treat a node that's been
     removed from a list as if it's still active.  If we call insertAfter on a
     node we've already removed, we may mangle the pointers.
</p></li>
</ol>



<p>
<img src="ditaa-images/img1_cdfafd9355a7753ba0348fcd1462b1afee467db8.png"  alt="ditaa-images/img1_cdfafd9355a7753ba0348fcd1462b1afee467db8.png" />
</p>

<p>
     The result violates the invariant that if x.next == y, then y.prev == x.
     We would prevent the pointer mangling if remove(n) set n's pointers to
     null, but that wouldn't stop insertAfter() from incrementing the list's
     "size" field (or throwing a NullPointerException), which is not a
     reasonable result.
</p>
<p>
     Calling remove(n) twice on the same node also corrupts "size".
</p>
<p>
     How can we fix this?
</p>
<p>
     ADT interface answer:  After n.remove() is executed, removing n from the
     list, n is considered to be an "invalid" node.  Any attempt to use n,
     except to call n.isValidNode(), throws an exception.
</p>
<p>
     Why do we change the node, rather than erasing the reference to it?
     First, the remove() method can't erase the reference, which is passed by
     value.  Second, there might be lots of other references to the same node,
     and we need to erase all of them too!  All those other references could be
     used to corrupt the data structure if the node itself isn't neutralized.
</p>
<p>
     Implementation answer:  When an item is removed from a list, the
     corresponding ListNode's "myList" reference is set to null.  This is just
     a convenient way to mark a node as "invalid".  The "next" and "prev"
     references are also set to null.  These steps eliminate opportunities for
     accidentally corrupting a list as illustrated above.  (Also, they help
     Java's garbage collection to reclaim unused DListNodes.  We'll discuss
     garbage collection near the end of the semester.)
</p>
<p>
     Any ListNode whose "myList" reference is null is considered "invalid",
     and any attempt to use it will incite an exception.
</p>
<ol>
<li>What happens if we walk off the end of a list?  (Using the next() method.)

<p>
     ADT interface answer:  In Homework 4, if you invoke next() on the last
     node in a list, it returns null.  In Homework 5, it returns an invalid
     node instead.  There are two reasons for this change.  First, it provides
     consistency, because invoking next() at the end of a list yields the same
     result as removing a node.  Second, if you call a method on the result--
     for instance, n.next().item()&ndash;it throws an InvalidNodeException instead
     of a NullPointerException.  This eliminates ambiguity; you can catch an
     InvalidNodeException without wondering why it was thrown, whereas many
     different bugs can cause NullPointerExceptions.
</p>
<p>
     Implementation answer:  Recall that our implementation uses a doubly-,
     circularly-linked list with a sentinel node.  Any sentinel is considered
     an invalid node.  This simplifies the implementations of the next() and
     prev() methods in the DList class.
</p>
<p>
     However, if you apply next() to a sentinel, you won't get the first node
     of the list; you'll get an InvalidNodeException.  Why?  When n is the last
     node in a list, why not let n.next().next() be the first node?  First, the
     fact that the implementation uses a sentinel should be completely hidden
     from the application.  Second, we want to be able to change the
     implementation without breaking the application.  Suppose we switch from
     DLists to SLists that don't have sentinels.  We would need to "fix" SList
     so that n.next().next() still behaves the way it does with DLists.  It's
     better not to allow applications to take advantage of such quirks from the
     start.
</p>
</li>
<li>How do we access an item?

<p>
     ADT interface answer:  In Homework 4, each node's "item" field is public.
     In Homework 5, we make the "item" field protected; applications must use
     the item() and setItem() methods to access it.  Why?  To make sure that
     applications can't store items in deleted nodes or sentinels.  Any attempt
     to invoke item() or setItem() on an invalid node causes an exception.
     Why?  So that the implementation can be changed without breaking an
     application.  Suppose, for instance, that an application stores items in
     sentinel nodes.  Would the application still work the same way if you
     switched from DLists to SLists, which don't have sentinel nodes?
</p>
<p>
     This may seem like a strange justification.  But in real-world
     programming, programmers often take advantage of undocumented quirks, like
     being able to store items in sentinel nodes.  Once applications have been
     written that depend on these quirks, the quirks become "features" that
     must be preserved in any new List implementation.  That's why ADTs should
     never do <span style="text-decoration:underline;">more</span> than what the documentation says they do.
</p>
<p>
     In Frederick P. Brooks, Jr.'s famous book on software engineering, "The
     Mythical Man-Month" (page 65), he writes
</p>
<p>
       Invalid syntax always produces some result; in a policed system that
       result is an invalidity indication <span style="text-decoration:underline;">and nothing more</span>.  In an unpoliced
       system all kinds of side effects may appear, and these may have been
       used by programmers.  When we undertook to emulate the IBM 1401
       [processor] on System/360 [an operating system], for example, it
       developed that there were 30 different "curios"&ndash;side effects of
       supposedly invalid operations&ndash;that had come into widespread use and had
       to be considered as part of the definition.  The implementation as a
       definition [of the functionality] overprescribed; it not only said what
       the machine must do, it also said a great deal about how it had to do
       it.
</p>
<p>
     By ensuring that an implementation does not produce any result not
     specified in the interface&ndash;even for invalid inputs&ndash;a programmer makes it
     easy to fix bugs, optimize performance, and add new features without
     compromising existing applications.
</p></li>
</ol>


<p>
This lecture's lesson is that design decisions can be complicated and have
unexpected repercussions.
</p>
<p>
Our design decisions for the Homework 5 lists, described above, will carry over
to our tree interfaces, which you'll encounter in an upcoming assignment.
</p>
<p>
One final thought.  Why don't we simply keep a boolean "valid" flag in each
ListNode, and use that to distinguish valid nodes from invalid ones?  It would
make the implementation clearer, and therefore more maintainable.  However, it
would also make each ListNode occupy more memory.  I chose reduced memory use
over readability, but this was an arbitrary choice.

Let T(n) be a function.  For now, T(n) is the algorithm's precise running time

</p>
<p>
Next, you must learn how to express this idea rigorously.  Here is the
central lesson of today's lecture, which will bear on your entire career as
a professional computer scientist, however abstruse it may seem now:
</p>



<pre class="src src-text">|=============================================================================|
| FORMALLY:  O(f(n)) is the SET of ALL functions T(n) that satisfy:           |
|                                                                             |

|                              T(n) &lt;= c f(n)                                 |
|=============================================================================|
</pre>


<p>
Pay close attention to c and N.  In the graph above, c = 20, and N = 1,000.
</p>
<p>
Think of it this way:  if you're trying to prove that one function is
asymptotically bounded by another [f(n) is in O(g(n))], you're allowed to
multiply them by positive constants in an attempt to stuff one underneath the
other.  You're also allowed to move the vertical line (N) as far to the right
as you like (to get all the crossings onto the left side).  We're only
interested in how the functions behave as n shoots off toward infinity.

<p>
Algorithms that run in O(n log n) time or faster are considered efficient.
Algorithms that take n<sup>7</sup> time or more are usually considered useless.  In the
region between n log n and n<sup>7</sup>, the usefulness of an algorithm depends on the
typical input sizes and the associated constants hidden by the Big-Oh notation.

<li>Here's a fallacious proof:

<p>
     n<sup>2</sup>  is in  O(n), because if we choose c = n, we get n<sup>2</sup> &lt;= n<sup>2</sup>.<br/>
  -&gt; WRONG!  c must be a constant; it cannot depend on n.
</p>
</li>
<li>The big-Oh notation expresses a relationship between functions.
     IT DOES NOT SAY WHAT THE FUNCTIONS MEAN.  In particular, the function on
     the left does not need to be the worst-case running time, though it often
     is.  The number of emails you send to your Mom as a function of time might
     be in O(t<sup>2</sup>).  In that case, not only are you a very good child; you're an
     increasingly good child.

<p>
     In binary search on an array,
</p>
<ul>
<li>the worst-case running time is in O(log n),
</li>
<li>the best-case running time is in O(1),
</li>
<li>the memory use is in O(n), and
</li>
<li>47 + 18 log n - 3/n is in O(the worst-case running time).

</li>
</ul>

<p>     Every semester, a few students get the wrong idea that "big-Oh" always
     means "worst-case running time."  Their brains short out when an exam
     question uses it some other way.
</p>
</li>
<li>"e<sup>3n</sup> is in O(e<sup>n</sup>) because constant factors don't matter."<br/>
     "10<sup>n</sup> is in O(2<sup>n</sup>) because constant factors don't matter."<br/>
  -&gt; WRONG!  I said that Big-Oh notation doesn't care about (most) constant
     factors.  Here are some of the exceptions.  A constant factor in an
     exponent is not the same as a constant factor in front of a term.
     e<sup>3n</sup> is not bigger than e<sup>n</sup> by a constant factor; it's bigger by a factor
     of e<sup>2n</sup>, which is damn big.  Likewise, 10<sup>n</sup> is bigger than 2<sup>n</sup> by a factor
     of 5<sup>n</sup>.

</li>
<li>Big-Oh notation doesn't tell the whole story, because it leaves out the
     constants.  If one algorithm runs in time T(n) = n log<sub>2</sub> n, and another
     algorithm runs in time U(n) = 100 n, then Big-Oh notation suggests you
     should use U(n), because T(n) dominates U(n) asymptotically.  However,
     U(n) is only faster than T(n) in practice if your input size is greater
     than current estimates of the number of subatomic particles in the
     universe.  The base-two logarithm log<sub>2</sub> n &lt; 50 for any input size n you
     are ever likely to encounter.

<p>
     Nevertheless, Big-Oh notation is still a good rule of thumb, because the
     hidden constants in real-world algorithms usually aren't that big.

<p>Suppose you have a set of two-letter words and their definitions.  You want to
be able to look up the definition of any word, very quickly.  The two-letter
word is the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">key</span> that addresses the definition.
</p>
<p>
Since there are 26 English letters, there are 26 * 26 = 676 possible two-letter
words.  To implement a dictionary, we declare an array of 676 references, all
initially set to null.  To insert a Definition into the dictionary, we define
a function hashCode() that maps each two-letter word (key) to a unique integer
between 0 and 675.  We use this integer as an index into the array, and make
the corresponding bucket (array position) point to the Definition object.

<p>
Suppose n is the number of keys (words) whose definitions we want to store, and
suppose we use a table of N buckets, where N is perhaps a bit larger than n,
but much smaller than the number of <span style="text-decoration:underline;">possible</span> keys.  A hash table maps a huge
set of possible keys into N buckets by applying a <span style="text-decoration:underline;">compression function</span> to
each hash code.  The obvious compression function is
</p>



<pre class="src src-java">h(hashCode) = hashCode mod N.
</pre>


<p>
Hash codes are often negative, so remember that mod is not the same as Java's
remainder operator "%".  If you compute hashCode % N, check if the result is
negative, and add N if it is.
</p>
<p>
With this compression function, no matter how long and variegated the keys are,
we can map them into a table whose size is not much greater than the actual
number of entries we want to store.  However, we've created a new problem:
several keys are hashed to the same bucket in the table if h(hashCode1) =
h(hashCode2).  This circumstance is called a <span style="text-decoration:underline;">collision</span>.
</p>
<p>
How do we handle collisions without losing entries?  We use a simple idea
called <span style="text-decoration:underline;">chaining</span>.  Instead of having each bucket in the table reference one
entry, we have it reference a linked list of entries, called a <span style="text-decoration:underline;">chain</span>.  If
several keys are mapped to the same bucket, their definitions all reside in
that bucket's linked list.
</p>
<p>
Chaining creates a second problem:  how do we know which definition corresponds
to which word?  The answer is that we must store each key in the table with its
definition.  The easiest way to do this is to have each listnode store an
<span style="text-decoration:underline;">entry</span> that has references to both a key (the word) and an associated value
(its definition).
</p>

</p>

<p>
Hash tables usually support at least three operations.  An Entry object
references a key and its associated value.
</p>
<ul>
<li>public Entry insert(key, value)<br/>
  Compute the key's hash code and compress it to determine the entry's bucket.
  Insert the entry (key and value together) into that bucket's list.

</li>
<li>public Entry find(key)<br/>
  Hash the key to determine its bucket.  Search the list for an entry with the
  given key.  If found, return the entry; otherwise, return null.

</li>
<li>public Entry remove(key)<br/>
  Hash the key to determine its bucket.  Search the list for an entry with the
  given key.  Remove it from the list if found.  Return the entry or null.
</li>
</ul>


<p>
What if two entries with the same key are inserted?  There are two approaches.
</p><ol>
<li>Following Goodrich and Tamassia, we can insert both, and have find() or
     remove() arbitrarily return/remove one.  Goodrich and Tamassia also
     propose a method findAll() that returns all the entries with a given key.
</li>
<li>Replace the old value with the new one, so only one entry with a given key
     exists in the table.
</li>
</ol>


<p>
Which approach is best?  It depends on the application.
</p>
<p>
WARNING:  When an object is stored as a key in a hash table, an application
should never change the object in a way that will change its hash code.
If you do so, the object will thenceforth be in the wrong bucket.
</p>
<p>
The <span style="text-decoration:underline;">load factor</span> of a hash table is n/N, where n is the number of keys in the
table and N is the number of buckets.  If the load factor stays below one (or
a small constant), and the hash code and compression function are "good," and
there are no duplicate keys, then the linked lists are all short, and each
operation takes O(1) time.  However, if the load factor grows too large
(n &gt;&gt; N), performance is dominated by linked list operations and degenerates to
O(n) time (albeit with a much smaller constant factor than if you replaced the
hash table with one singly-linked list).  A proper analysis requires a little
probability theory, so we'll put it off until near the end of the semester.

<h3 id="sec-20-3">Hash Codes and Compression Functions</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-20-3">

<p>Hash codes and compression functions are a bit of a black art.  The ideal hash
code and compression function would map each key to a uniformly distributed
random bucket from zero to N - 1.  By "random", I don't mean that the function
is different each time; a given key always hashes to the same bucket.  I mean
that two different keys, however similar, will hash to independently chosen
integers, so the probability they'll collide is 1/N.  This ideal is tricky to
obtain.
</p>
<p>
In practice, it's easy to mess up and create far more collisions than
necessary.  Let's consider bad compression functions first.  Suppose the keys
are integers, and each integer's hash code is itself, so hashCode(i) = i.
</p>
<p>
Suppose we use the compression function h(hashCode) = hashCode mod N, and the
number N of buckets is 10,000.  Suppose for some reason that our application
only ever generates keys that are divisible by 4.  A number divisible by 4 mod
10,000 is still a number divisible by 4, so three quarters of the buckets are
never used!  Thus the average bucket has about four times as many entries as it
ought to.
</p>
<p>
The same compression function is much better if N is prime.  With N prime, even
if the hash codes are always divisible by 4, numbers larger than N often hash
to buckets not divisible by 4, so all the buckets can be used.
</p>
<p>
For reasons I won't explain (see Goodrich and Tamassia Section 9.2.4 if you're
interested),
</p>



<pre class="src src-java">h(hashCode) = ((a * hashCode + b) mod p) mod N
</pre>


<p>
is a yet better compression function.  Here, a, b, and p are positive integers,
p is a large prime, and p &gt;&gt; N.  Now, the number N of buckets doesn't need to
be prime.
</p>
<p>
I recommend always using a known good compression function like the two above.
Unfortunately, it's still possible to mess up by inventing a hash code that
creates lots of conflicts even before the compression function is used.  We'll
discuss hash codes next lecture.

<p>
By multiplying the hash code by 127 before adding in each new character, we
make sure that each character has a different effect on the final result.  The
"%" operator with a prime number tends to "mix up the bits" of the hash code.
The prime is chosen to be large, but not so large that 127 * hashVal +
key.charAt(i) will ever exceed the maximum possible value of an int.
</p>
<p>
The best way to understand good hash codes is to understand why bad hash codes
are bad.  Here are some examples of bad hash codes on Words.
</p>
<ol>
<li>Sum up the ASCII values of the characters.  Unfortunately, the sum will
       rarely exceed 500 or so, and most of the entries will be bunched up in
       a few hundred buckets.  Moreover, anagrams like "pat," "tap," and "apt"
       will collide.
</li>
<li>Use the first three letters of a word, in a table with 26<sup>3</sup> buckets.
       Unfortunately, words beginning with "pre" are much more common than
       words beginning with "xzq", and the former will be bunched up in one
       long list.  This does not approach our uniformly distributed ideal.
</li>
<li>Consider the "good" hashCode() function written out above.  Suppose the
       prime modulus is 127 instead of 16908799.  Then the return value is just
       the last character of the word, because (127 * hashVal) % 127 = 0.
       That's why 127 and 16908799 were chosen to have no common factors.
</li>
</ol>


<p>
Why is the hashCode() function presented above good?  Because we can find no
obvious flaws, and it seems to work well in practice.  (A black art indeed.)

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-21-1-2">

<p>Sometimes we can't predict in advance how many entries we'll need to store.  If
the load factor n/N (entries per bucket) gets too large, we are in danger of
losing constant-time performance.
</p>
<p>
One option is to enlarge the hash table when the load factor becomes too large
(typically larger than 0.75).  Allocate a new array (typically at least twice
as long as the old), then walk through all the entries in the old array and
<span style="text-decoration:underline;">rehash</span> them into the new.
</p>
<p>
Take note:  you CANNOT just copy the linked lists to the same buckets in the
new array, because the compression functions of the two arrays will certainly
be incompatible.  You have to rehash each entry individually.
</p>
<p>
You can also shrink hash tables (e.g., when n/N &lt; 0.25) to free memory, if you
think the memory will benefit something else.  (In practice, it's only
sometimes worth the effort.)
</p>
<p>
Obviously, an operation that causes a hash table to resize itself takes
more than O(1) time; nevertheless, the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">average</span> over the long run is still

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-21-1-3">

<p>An inefficiency of unadorned game tree search is that some grids can be reached
through many different sequences of moves, and so the same grid might be
evaluated many times.  To reduce this expense, maintain a hash table that
records previously encountered grids.  This dictionary is called a
<span style="text-decoration:underline;">transposition table</span>.  Each time you compute a grid's score, insert into the
dictionary an entry whose key is the grid and whose value is the grid's score.
Each time the minimax algorithm considers a grid, it should first check whether
the grid is in the transposition table; if so, its score is returned
immediately.  Otherwise, its score is evaluated recursively and stored in the
transposition table.
</p>
<p>
Transposition tables will only help you with your project if you can search to
a depth of at least three ply (within the five second time limit).  It takes
three ply to reach the same grid two different ways.
</p>
<p>
After each move is taken, the transposition table should be emptied, because
you will want to search grids to a greater depth than you did during the
previous move.

Why talk about Stacks when we already have Lists?  Mainly so you can carry on
discussions with other computer programmers.  If somebody tells you that
an algorithm uses a stack, the limitations of a stack give you a hint how
the algorithm works.

Sample application:  Verifying matched parentheses in a String like
"{[(){[]}]()}".  Scan through the String, character by character.
  o  When you encounter a lefty&ndash;'{', '[', or '('&ndash;push it onto the stack.
  o  When you encounter a righty, pop its counterpart from atop the stack, and
     check that they match.
If there's a mismatch or null returned, or if the stack is not empty when you

<p>
^^^^^^^^^^  Compare with the definition of Big-Oh:  T(n) &lt;= c f(n). ^^^^^^^^^^^
</p>
<p>
Omega is the reverse of Big-Oh.  If T(n) is in O(f(n)), f(n) is in Omega(T(n)).
</p>
<p>
  2n   is in Omega(n)                 BECAUSE    n                is in O(2n). <br/>
  n<sup>2</sup>  is in Omega(n)                 BECAUSE    n                is in O(n<sup>2</sup>). <br/>
  n<sup>2</sup>  is in Omega(3 n<sup>2</sup> + n log n)   BECAUSE    3 n<sup>2</sup> + n log n  is in O(n<sup>2</sup>). <br/>
</p>
<p>
Big-Omega gives us a LOWER BOUND on a function, just as Big-Oh gives us an
UPPER BOUND.  Big-Oh says, "Your algorithm is at least this good."  Big-Omega
says, "Your algorithm is at least this bad."
</p>
<p>
Recall that Big-Oh notation can be misleading because, for instance,
n is in O(n<sup>8</sup>).  If we know both a lower bound and an upper bound for
a function, and they're both the same bound asymptotically (i.e. they differ
only by a constant factor), we can use Big-Theta notation to precisely specify
the function's asymptotic behavior.

<p>
But how can a function be sandwiched between f(n) and f(n)?<br/>
Easy:  we choose different constants (c and d) for the upper bound and lower

<p>
If we extend this graph infinitely far to the right, and find that T(n) remains
always sandwiched between 2n and 10n, then T(n) is in Theta(n).  If T(n) is an
algorithm's worst-case running time, the algorithm will never exhibit worse
than linear performance, but it can't be counted on to exhibit better than
linear performance, either.
</p>
<p>
Theta is symmetric:  if f(n) is in Theta(g(n)), then g(n) is in Theta(f(n)).
For instance, n<sup>3</sup> is in Theta(3 n<sup>3</sup> - n<sup>2</sup>), and 3 n<sup>3</sup> - n<sup>2</sup> is in Theta(n<sup>3</sup>).
n<sup>3</sup> is not in Theta(n), and n is not in Theta(n<sup>3</sup>).
</p>
<p>
Big-Theta notation isn't potentially misleading in the way Big-Oh notation
can be:  n is NOT in Omega(n<sup>8</sup>).  If your algorithm's running time is in
Theta(n<sup>8</sup>), it IS slow.
</p>
<p>
However, some functions are not in "Theta" of anything simple.  For example,
the function f(n) = n (1 + sin n) is in O(n) and Omega(0), but it's not in
Theta(n) nor Theta(0).  f(n) keeps oscillating back and forth between zero and
ever-larger numbers.  We could say that f(n) is in Theta(2n (1 + sin n)), but
that's not a simplification.
</p>
<p>
Remember that the choice of O, Omega, or Theta is <span style="text-decoration:underline;">independent</span> of whether
we're talking about worst-case running time, best-case running time,
average-case running time, memory use, annual beer consumption as a function of
population, or some other function.  The function has to be specified.
"Big-Oh" is NOT a synonym for "worst-case running time," and Omega is not a
synonym for "best-case running time."

<p>Suppose you have an array containing n music albums, sorted by

<p>
Algorithm #4:  Search for one matching album with binary search.
               Walk (in both directions) to find the other matching albums.
</p>
<p>
  Binary search takes at most log n steps to find a matching album (if one
  exists).  Next, the complete list of k matching albums is found, each in
  constant time.  Thus, the worst-case running time is in
</p>
<p>
    Theta(log n + k).
</p>
<p>
  Because k can be as large as n, it is not dominated by the log n term.
  Because k can be as small as zero, it does not dominate the log n term.
  Hence, there is no simpler expression for the worst-case running time.

<p>
  Algorithms like this are called <span style="text-decoration:underline;">output-sensitive</span>, because their performance

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-23-1">

<p>A <span style="text-decoration:underline;">tree</span> consists of a set of nodes and a set of edges that connect pairs of
nodes.  A tree has the property that there is exactly one path (no more, no
less) between any two nodes of the tree.  A <span style="text-decoration:underline;">path</span> is a sequence of one or more
nodes, each consecutive pair being connected by an edge.
</p>
<p>
In a <span style="text-decoration:underline;">rooted</span> tree, one distinguished node is called the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">root</span>.  Every node c,
except the root, has exactly one <span style="text-decoration:underline;">parent</span> node p, which is the first node after
c on the path from c to the root.  c is p's <span style="text-decoration:underline;">child</span>.  The root has no parent.
A node can have any number of children.
</p>
<p>
Some other definitions:
</p>
<ul>
<li>A <span style="text-decoration:underline;">leaf</span> is a node with no children.
</li>
<li>An <span style="text-decoration:underline;">internal node</span> is a non-leaf node (having one or more children).
</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Siblings</span> are nodes with the same parent.
</li>
<li>The <span style="text-decoration:underline;">ancestors</span> of a node d are the nodes on the path from d to the root.
    These include d's parent, d's parent's parent, d's parent's parent's
    parent, and so forth up to the root.  Technically, the ancestors of d also
    include d itself, which makes you wonder about d's sex life.  The root is
    an ancestor of every node in the tree.
</li>
<li>If a is an ancestor of d, then d is a <span style="text-decoration:underline;">descendant</span> of a.
</li>
<li>The <span style="text-decoration:underline;">length</span> of a path is the number of edges in the path.
</li>
<li>The <span style="text-decoration:underline;">depth</span> of a node n is the length of the path from n to the root.  (The
    depth of the root is zero.)
</li>
<li>The <span style="text-decoration:underline;">height</span> of a node n is the length of the path from n to its deepest
    descendant.  (The height of a leaf node is zero.)
</li>
<li>The height of a tree is the depth of its deepest node = height of the root.
</li>
<li>The <span style="text-decoration:underline;">subtree</span> rooted at node n is the tree formed by n and its descendants.
</li>
<li>A <span style="text-decoration:underline;">binary tree</span> is a tree in which no node has more than two children, and
    every child is either a <span style="text-decoration:underline;">left child</span> or a <span style="text-decoration:underline;">right child</span>, even if it's the
    only child its parent has.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-23-2">

<p>Goodrich and Tamassia present a data structure in which each node has three
references:  one reference to an item, one reference to the node's parent, and
one reference to the node's children, which can be stored in any reasonable
data structure like a linked list.  Directories are typically stored this way,
but the lists they use are represented very differently than our list ADTs.
</p>
<p>
Another popular tree representation spurns separately encapsulated linked lists
so that siblings are directly linked.  It retains the "item" and "parent"
references, but instead of referencing a list of children, each node references
just its leftmost child.  Each node also references its next sibling to the
right.  The "nextSibling" references are used to join the children of a node in
a singly-linked list, whose head is the node's "firstChild".
</p>
<p>
I'll call this tree a "SibTree", since siblings are central to the
representation.  The nodes I call "SibTreeNodes".

<h3 id="sec-23-3">Tree Traversals</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-23-3">

<p>A <span style="text-decoration:underline;">traversal</span> is a manner of <span style="text-decoration:underline;">visiting</span> each node in a tree once.  What you do
when visiting any particular node depends on the application; for instance,
you might print a node's value, or perform some calculation upon it.  There
are several different traversals, each of which orders the nodes differently.
</p>
<p>
Many traversals can be defined recursively.  In a <span style="text-decoration:underline;">preorder</span> traversal, you
visit each node before recursively visiting its children, which are visited
from left to right.  The root is visited first.
</p>



<pre class="src src-java"><span style="color: #a020f0;">class</span> <span style="color: #228b22;">SibTreeNode</span> {
    <span style="color: #a020f0;">public</span> <span style="color: #228b22;">void</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">preorder</span>() {
        <span style="color: #a020f0;">this</span>.visit();
        <span style="color: #a020f0;">if</span> (firstChild != <span style="color: #008b8b;">null</span>) {
            firstChild.preorder();
        }
        <span style="color: #a020f0;">if</span> (nextSibling != <span style="color: #008b8b;">null</span>) {
            nextSibling.preorder();
        }
    }
}
</pre>


<p>
Suppose your method visit() numbers the nodes in the order they're visited.
A preorder traversal visits the nodes in this order.
</p>



<pre class="src src-java">     1
    / \
   /   \
  2     6
 /|\   / \
3 4 5 7   8
</pre>


<p>
Each node is visited only once, so a preorder traversal takes O(n) time, where
n is the number of nodes in the tree.  All the traversals we will consider take
O(n) time.
</p>
<p>
A preorder traversal is a natural way to print a directory's structure.
Simply have the method visit() print each node of the tree.
</p>



<pre class="src src-texta">~jrs/61b

      hw1
      hw2

   lec
      01
      02
      03
      04
      05
</pre>


<p>
In a <span style="text-decoration:underline;">postorder</span> traversal, you visit each node's children (in left-to-right
order) before the node itself.
</p>



<pre class="src src-java"><span style="color: #a020f0;">public</span> <span style="color: #228b22;">void</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">postorder</span>() {
    <span style="color: #a020f0;">if</span> (firstChild != <span style="color: #008b8b;">null</span>) {
        firstChild.postorder();
    }
    <span style="color: #a020f0;">this</span>.visit();
    <span style="color: #a020f0;">if</span> (nextSibling != <span style="color: #008b8b;">null</span>) {
        nextSibling.postorder();
    }
}
</pre>


<p>
A postorder traversal visits the nodes in this order.
</p>



<pre class="src src-java">     8
    / \
   /   \
  4     7
 /|\   / \
1 2 3 5   6
</pre>


<p>
The postorder() code is trickier than it looks.  The best way to understand it
is to draw a depth-two tree on paper, then pretend you're the computer and
execute the algorithm carefully.  Trust me on this.  It's worth your time.
</p>
<p>
A postorder traversal is the natural way to sum the total disk space used in
the root directory and its descendants.  The method visit() sums "this" node's
disk space with the disk space of all its children.  In the example above, a
postorder traversal would first sum the sizes of the files in hw1/ and hw2/;
then it would visit hw/ and sum its two children.  The last thing it would
compute is the total disk space at the root ~jrs/61b/, which sums all the
files in the tree.
</p>
<p>
Binary trees allow for an <span style="text-decoration:underline;">inorder</span> traversal:  recursively traverse the root's
left subtree (rooted at the left child), then the root itself, then the root's
right subtree.  The preorder, inorder, and postorder traversals of an
expression tree will print a <span style="text-decoration:underline;">prefix</span>, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">infix</span>, or <span style="text-decoration:underline;">postfix</span> expression,
respectively.
</p>



<pre class="src src-text">     +
    / \         Prefix:  + * 3 7 ^ 4 2
   /   \
  *     ^        Infix:  3 * 7 + 4 ^ 2
 / \   / \
3   7 4   2    Postfix:  3 7 * 4 2 ^ +
</pre>


<p>
In a <span style="text-decoration:underline;">level-order</span> traversal, you visit the root, then all the depth-1 nodes
(from left to right), then all the depth-2 nodes, et cetera.  The level-order
traversal of our expression tree is "+ * ^ 3 7 4 2" (which doesn't mean much).
</p>
<p>
Unlike the three previous traversals, a level-order traversal is not
straightforward to define recursively.  However, a level-order traversal can be
done in O(n) time.  Use a queue, which initially contains only the root.  Then
repeat the following steps:
</p><ul>
<li>Dequeue a node.
</li>
<li>Visit it.
</li>
<li>Enqueue its children (in order from left to right).
</li>
</ul>

<p>Continue until the queue is empty.
</p>
<p>
A final thought:  if you use a stack instead of a queue, and push each node's
children in reverse order&ndash;from right to left (so they pop off the stack in
order from left to right)&ndash;you perform a preorder traversal.  Think about why.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-24-1">

<p>A priority queue, like a dictionary, contains <span style="text-decoration:underline;">entries</span> that each consist of
a key and an associated value.  However, whereas a dictionary is used when we
want to be able to look up arbitrary keys, a priority queue is used to
prioritize entries.  Define a total order on the keys (e.g. alphabetical
order).  You may identify or remove the entry whose key is the lowest (but no
other entry).  This limitation helps to make priority queues fast.  However, an
entry with any key may be inserted at any time.
</p>
<p>
For concreteness, let's use Integer objects as our keys.  The main operations:
</p><ul>
<li>insert() adds an entry to the priority queue;
</li>
<li>min() returns the entry with the minimum key; and
</li>
<li>removeMin() both removes and returns the entry with the minimum key.
</li>
</ul>





<pre class="src src-text">                key

<p>
Priority queues are most commonly used as "event queues" in simulations.  Each
value on the queue is an event that is expected to take place, and each key
is the time the event takes place.  A simulation operates by removing
successive events from the queue and simulating them.  This is why most
priority queues return the minimum, rather than maximum, key:  we want to
simulate the events that occur first first.

<p>
A <span style="text-decoration:underline;">binary heap</span> is a complete binary tree whose entries satisfy the
<span style="text-decoration:underline;">heap-order property</span>:  no child has a key less than its parent's key.
Observe that every subtree of a binary heap is also a binary heap, because
every subtree is complete and satisfies the heap-order property.
</p>
<p>
Because it is complete, a binary heap can be stored compactly as an array of
entries.  We map tree nodes to array indices with <span style="text-decoration:underline;">level numbering</span>, which
places the root at index 1 and orders the remaining nodes by a level-order
traversal of the tree.
</p>
<p>
Observe that if a node's index is i, its children's indices are 2i and 2i+1,
and its parent's index is floor(i/2).  Hence, no node needs to store explicit
references to its parent or children.  (Array index 0 is left empty to make the
indexing work out nicely.  If we instead put the root at index 0, node i's
children are at indices 2i+1 and 2i+2, and its parent is at floor([i-1]/2).)
</p>
<p>
We can use either an array-based or a node-and-reference-based tree data
structure, but the array representation tends to be faster (by a significant
constant factor) because there is no need to read and write the references that
connect nodes to each other, cache performance is better, and finding the last
node in the level order is easier.
</p>
<p>
Just like in hash tables, either each tree node has two references (one for the
key, and one for the value), or each node references an "Entry" object (see
page 340 of Goodrich and Tamassia).
</p>
<p>
Let's look at how we implement priority queue operations with a binary heap.
</p>
<p>
 1]  Entry min();
</p>
<p>
The heap-order property ensures that the entry with the minimum key is always
at the top of the heap.  Hence, we simply return the entry at the root node.
If the heap is empty, return null or throw an exception.
</p>
<p>
 2]  Entry insert(Object k, Object v);
</p>
<p>
Let x be the new entry (k, v), whose key is k and whose value is v.  We place
the new entry x in the bottom level of the tree, at the first free spot from
the left.  (If the bottom level is full, start a new level with x at the far
left.)  In an array-based implementation, we place x in the first free location
in the array (excepting index 0).
</p>
<p>
Of course, the new entry's key may violate the heap-order property.  We correct
this by having the entry bubble up the tree until the heap-order property is
satisfied.  More precisely, we compare x's key with its parent's key.
While x's key is less, we exchange x with its parent, then repeat the test with
x's new parent.  Continue until x's key is greater than or equal to its parent,
or x reaches the root.  For instance, if we insert an entry whose key is 2:
</p>

       / \                / \                / \                / \
      /   \              /   \              /   \              /   \
     5     3            5     3            5     3            2     3
    / \   / \    =&gt;    / \   / \    =&gt;    / \   / \    =&gt;    / \   / \
   9   6 11  4        9   6 11  4        9   2 11  4        9   5 11  4
  / \ /              / \ / \            / \ / \            / \ / \
17 10 8            17 10 8  2         17 10 8  6         17 10 8  6
</pre>


<p>
As this example illustrates, a heap can contain multiple entries with the same
key.  (After all, in a typical simulation, we can't very well outlaw multiple
events happening at the same time.)
</p>



<pre class="src src-text">When we finish, is the heap-order property satisfied?          p          x
Yes, if the heap-order property was satisfied before the      / \        / \
insertion.  Let's look at a typical exchange of x with a     s   x  =&gt;  s   p
parent p (right) during the insertion operation.  Since     /\   /\    /\   /\
the heap-order property was satisfied before the insertion,     l  r       l  r
</pre>

<p>
we know that p &lt;= s (where s is x's sibling), p &lt;= l, and
p &lt;= r (where l and r are x's children).  We swap only if x &lt; p, which implies
that x &lt; s; after the swap, x is the parent of s.  After the swap, p is the
parent of l and r.  All other relationships in the subtree rooted at x are
unchanged, so after the swap, the tree rooted at x has the heap-order property.
</p>
<p>
For maximum speed, don't put x at the bottom of the tree and bubble it up.
Instead, bubble a hole up the tree, then fill in x.  This modification saves
the time that would be spent setting a sequence of references to x that are
going to change anyway.
</p>
<p>
insert() returns an Entry object representing (k, v).
</p>
<p>
 3]  Entry removeMin();
</p>
<p>
If the heap is empty, return null or throw an exception.  Otherwise, begin by
removing the entry at the root node and saving it for the return value.  This
leaves a gaping hole at the root.  We fill the hole with the last entry in the
tree (which we call "x"), so that the tree is still complete.
</p>
<p>
It is unlikely that x has the minimum key.  Fortunately, both subtrees rooted
at the root's children are heaps, and thus the new mimimum key is one of these
two children.  We bubble x down the heap until the heap-order property is
satisfied, as follows.  We compare x's key with both its children's keys.
While x has a child whose key is smaller, swap x with the child having the
minimum key, then repeat the test with x's new children.  Continue until x is
less than or equal to its children, or reaches a leaf.
</p>
<p>
Consider running removeMin() on our original tree.

<p>
 *If you're using an array-based data structure, these running times assume
  that you don't run out of room.  If you do, it will take Theta(n) time to
  allocate a larger array and copy the entries into it.  However, if you
  double the array size each time, the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">average</span> running time will still be
  as indicated.<br/>
 **  Removing the minimum from a sorted array in constant time is most easily
     done by keeping the array always sorted from largest to smallest.
</p>
<p>
In a binary heap, min's running time is clearly in Theta(1).
</p>
<p>
insert() puts an entry x at the bottom of the tree and bubbles it up.  At each
level of the tree, it takes O(1) time to compare x with its parent and swap if
indicated.  An n-node complete binary tree has height floor(log2 n).  In the
worst case, x will bubble all the way to the top, taking Theta(log n) time.
</p>
<p>
Similarly, removeMin() may cause an entry to bubble all the way down the heap,
taking Theta(log n) worst-case time.

<p>Suppose we are given a bunch of randomly ordered entries, and want to make a

there's a faster way.  We define one more heap operation.
</p>
<p>
 4]  void bottomUpHeap();
</p>
<p>
First, we make a complete tree out of the entries, in any order.  (If we're
using an array representation, we just throw all the entries into an array.)
Then we work backward from the last internal node (non-leaf node) to the root
node, in reverse order in the array or the level-order traversal.  When we
visit a node this way, we bubble its entry down the heap as in removeMin().
</p>
<p>
Before we bubble an entry down, we know (inductively) that its two child
subtrees are heaps.  Hence, by bubbling the entry down, we create a larger heap
rooted at the node where that entry started.

<p>
The running time of bottomUpHeap is tricky to derive.  If each internal node
bubbles all the way down, then the running time is proportional to the sum of
the heights of all the nodes in the tree.  Page 371 of Goodrich and Tamassia
has a simple and elegant argument showing that this sum is less than n, where n
is the number of entries being coalesced into a heap.  Hence, the running time
is in Theta(n), which beats inserting n entries into a heap individually.

<h3 id="sec-24-5">Postscript:  Other Types of Heaps (not examinable)</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-24-5">

<p>Binary heaps are not the only heaps in town.  Several important variants are
called "mergeable heaps", because it is relatively fast to combine two
mergeable heaps together into a single mergeable heap.  We will not describe
these complicated heaps in CS 61B, but it's worthwhile for you to know they
exist in case you ever need one.
</p>
<p>
The best-known mergeable heaps are called "binomial heaps," "Fibonacci heaps,"
"skew heaps," and "pairing heaps."  Fibonacci heaps have another remarkable
property:  if you have a reference to an arbitrary node in a Fibonacci heap,
you can decrease its key in constant time.  (Pairing heaps are suspected of
having the same property, but nobody knows for sure.)  This operation is used
frequently by Dijkstra's algorithm, an important algorithm for finding the
shortest path in a graph.  The following running times are all worst-case.

The time bounds given here for skew heaps, pairing heaps, and Fibonacci heaps
are "amortized" bounds, not worst case bounds.  This means that, if you start
from an empty heap, any sequence of operations will take no more than the given
time bound on average, although individual operations may occasionally take
longer.  We'll discuss amortized analysis near the end of the semester.
